# umask command
In `Linux` and other `Unix`-like operating systems, when new files are created, a set of default permissions will be used. Specifically, the way in which new file permissions are restricted can be defined through the use of a permission mask called `umask`. The `umask` command is used to set a default permission mask when creating files, or to display the current mask value.

## Syntax

```shell
umask [-S] [mask]
```
## Parameters
* `-S`: Represents the mask in symbolic mode.
* `mask`: Specifies an effective mask value. If none is specified, the current `umask` value is returned.

## Permissions
Use the `ll` command to view file and directory information. Regarding its permission information:

```shell
drwxr-xr-x 12 linuxize users 4.0K Apr  8 20:51 dirname
|[-][-][-]    [------] [---]
| |  |  |        |       |       
| |  |  |        |       +-----------> Group
| |  |  +-------------------> Owner
| |  +-----------------------> Others Permissions
| +--------------------------> Group Permissions
+----------------------------> Owner Permissions
```

* The first symbol `-` represents a regular file, while `d` represents a directory.
* The next three characters `rw-` represent the user `u` permission attributes.
* The next three characters `r--` represent the user group `g` permission attributes.
* The last three characters `r--` represent the other `o` permissions.

Permissions can be represented using characters, and can also be represented in octal numbers: 
* `r`: Read attribute, with a value of `4`.
* `w`: Write attribute, with a value of `2`.
* `x`: Execute attribute, with a value of `1`.

Regarding operators for manipulating permissions:
* `+`: Adds specified file permissions for the specified user class.
* `-`: Removes specified file permissions for the specified user class.
* `=`: Assigns specified file permissions for the specified user class.

## Work  
Essentially, each digit of `umask` is subtracted from the operating systemâ€™s default value to obtain the defined default value. This is not true subtraction, it technically involves taking the bitwise complement of the mask and then applying this value using a logical `AND` operation to the default permissions. For example, if the `umask` value is `0022`:
* On a `Linux` system, the default file creation permission is `666`, and the default folder creation permission is `777`.
* So, `666 - 022 = 644`, which means the permission of the newly created file is `644`.
* For folders, `777 - 022 = 755`, meaning the permission of the newly created folder is `755`.

Also, the leading zero is a special permission number that can be ignored. For the current purpose, `0002` is the same as `002`.

## Examples
View the current `umask` value in the system.

```shell
umask
# 0022 
```

Represent the current system permission mask in symbolic form.

```shell
umask -S
# u=rwx,g=rx,o=rx # effectively expressing which permissions have been revoked for the owner, group, and other.
```

Set the system `umask` value to `022`.

```shell
umask 022
```
