# Smallest Subarray with Sum
Given an array consisting of `n` positive integers and a positive integer `s`, find the length of the smallest contiguous subarray with a sum `≥ s` and return its length. If there is no such subarray satisfying the condition, return `0`.

## Example

```
Input: s = 7, nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: The subarray [4,3] is the smallest contiguous subarray under this condition.
```

## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} s
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var minSubArrayLen = function(s, nums) {
    if(!nums.length) return 0;
    var start=0, end=0;
    var sum = 0;
    var target = Infinity;
    while(start < nums.length){
        if( sum < s && end < nums.length){
            sum += nums[end++];
        }else{
            if(sum >= s && target > (end - start)) target = end - start;
            sum -= nums[start++];
        } 
    }
    return target === Infinity ? 0 : target;
};
```

## Idea
Using the two-pointer approach to form a dynamic sliding window. Where `start` is the initial pointer and `end` is the ending pointer, `Infinity` is a value representing infinity. The window is initially of size `0`, and `sum` is initialized as `0`. If `sum < s`, the end pointer keeps moving to the right as long as end is less than the length of `nums`. This is because the window values need to keep increasing to reach a sum `≥ s`. When the sum of window values is greater than or equal to `s`, the start pointer moves to the right to reduce the size of the window. Reducing the window size continuously is necessary to obtain the length of the smallest contiguous subarray. When the end pointer reaches the end boundary of the `nums` array, it stops moving to the right and the start pointer continuously moves to the right until its length is equal to the length of the `nums` array. The loop ends, and finally, it is checked whether `target` is still equal to `Infinity`. If it is still equal to `Infinity`, no suitable subarray length is found, and `0` is returned; otherwise, `target` is returned.
