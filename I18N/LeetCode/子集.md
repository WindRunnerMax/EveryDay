# Subsets
Given an array of integers `nums` without duplicates, return all possible subsets (the power set) of the array.  
Note: The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets.

## Example

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output:
[
  [3],
  [1],
  [2],
  [1,2,3],
  [1,3],
  [2,3],
  [1,2],
  []
]
```

## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number[][]}
 */
var subsets = function(nums) {
    var target = [[]];
    var n = nums.length;
    if(!n) return target;
    var dfs = (cur, tmp ,deep, limit) => {
        if (tmp.length + (n - cur + 1) < limit) return void 0;
        if(limit === deep) {
            target.push(tmp);
            return void 0;
        }
        for(let i=cur;i<n; ++i){
            dfs(i+1, [...tmp, nums[i]], deep+1, limit);
        }
    }
    nums.forEach((v,i) => dfs(0, [], 0, i+1));
    return target;
};

/**
    dfs(i+1, [...tmp, nums[i]], deep+1, limit);
        1         2          3
      2   3       3      
    ...   ...    ...
    dfs(cur+1, [...tmp, nums[i]], deep+1, limit);
        1         2          3
      2   3     2   3      2   3 
     ... ...   ... ...    ...  ...
 */
```

## Idea
Essentially, this is a combination problem. Taking an array of length `4` like `[1, 2, 3, 4]` and combining `2` values as an example, for every two elements, we can form an array like `[1, 2]`, `[1, 3]`, `[1, 4]`, `[2, 3]`, `[2, 4]`, and `[3, 4]`. Following this logic, we need to extract subsets of lengths `1` to `length` from the given array. First, we define the target array which will include an empty array, signifying all arrays are subsets of themselves. We then calculate the length `n` of the input array. If the length is `0`, we return the target array. We then define a recursive function to traverse the depths of the problem. First, we perform pruning. If the size of the current `tmp` array is `s` and the length of the undecided interval `[cur,n]` is `t`, if `s + t < limit`, even if all `t` elements are selected, it is impossible to construct a sequence of length `limit`. Hence, there is no need to continue recursion in this case. We then check if the recursion depth equals `limit`, and if so, we add the `tmp` array to the target array and return. Next, we define a loop from `cur` to `n`, and pass a new array constructed from `tmp` with `cur` to the next recursion. Finally, we define a loop to get the length of the subset array to be obtained, start the recursion, initialize `cur` as `0`, `deep` as `0`, `tmp` as an empty array, and `limit` as `i+1`. After the recursion is completed, the target array is returned.
