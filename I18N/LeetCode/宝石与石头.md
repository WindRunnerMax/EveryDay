# Jewels and Stones

Given a string `J` representing the types of stones that are jewels, and a string `S` representing the stones you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

The letters in `J` are distinct, and all characters in `J` and `S` are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so `a` and `A` are considered different types of stones.

## Example

```
Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
```

```
Input: J = "z", S = "ZZ"
Output: 0
```

## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} J
 * @param {string} S
 * @return {number}
 */
var numJewelsInStones = function(J, S) {
    var hashTable = {};
    var target = 0;
    Array.prototype.forEach.call(J, v => hashTable[v] = 1);
    Array.prototype.forEach.call(S, v => {
        if(hashTable[v]) ++target;
    })
    return target;
};
```

## Idea
If we directly use a brute-force traversal, the time complexity will be relatively high. By using a hash table to record the types of jewels, and then traversing the string to find the jewels we have, it can be achieved. First, define `HashTable` to record the types of jewels. Then define the target count to start at `0`. Next, iterate through the strings. For convenience, directly call the `forEach` method of the `Array` prototype, and use the arrow function. Assign the value of the type of jewel to `1`. Similarly, traverse the string to determine if the value is defined as a jewel in the hash table. If it is, increase the target count `++`. Finally, return the target count.
