# Unique Number of Occurrences

Given an integer array `arr`, please help to count the occurrences of each number in the array.

Return `true` if the occurrences of each number are unique, otherwise return `false`.

## Example

```plaintext
Input: arr = [1,2,2,1,1,3]
Output: true
Explanation: In this array, 1 appears 3 times, 2 appears 2 times, and 3 appears only 1 time. There are no two numbers with the same number of occurrences.
```

```plaintext
Input: arr = [1,2]
Output: false
```

```plaintext
Input: arr = [-3,0,1,-3,1,1,1,-3,10,0]
Output: true
```

## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} arr
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var uniqueOccurrences = function(arr) {
    var hashTable = Object.create(null);
    arr.forEach(v => {
        if(hashTable[v] === void 0) hashTable[v] = 1;
        else ++hashTable[v];
    })
    var keys = Object.keys(hashTable);
    var values = Object.values(hashTable);
    return keys.length === [...new Set(values)].length;
};
```

## Approach
Use a hash table to record the occurrences of each number, then use a `Set` to handle the occurrences, and finally compare the length of the hash table with the length of the `Set`. First, define a hash table, in this case, we use a regular object in JavaScript, but `Map` object in `Js` can also be used as a key-value hash table solution. After that, iterate through the array, if the key is undefined, set the value of this key in the hash table to `1`, otherwise increment the value. Then get all the keys and values from the object, use a `Set` to deduplicate the values array, and then compare the length of the deduplicated array with the length of the keys array, and return the result.
