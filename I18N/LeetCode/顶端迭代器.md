# Top Iterator
Given an interface of an iterator class that contains two methods: `next()` and `hasNext()`. Design and implement a top iterator that supports the `peek()` operation, which essentially retrieves the element that should have been returned by the `next()` method.

## Example
```
Suppose the iterator is initialized to the list [1,2,3].

Calling next() returns 1, the first element of the list.
Now calling peek() returns 2, the next element. Subsequent calls to next() still return 2.
The last call to next() returns 3, the last element. Subsequent call to hasNext() should return false.
```

## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * // This is the Iterator's API interface.
 * // You should not implement it, or speculate about its implementation.
 * function Iterator() {
 *    @return {number}
 *    this.next = function() { // return the next number of the iterator
 *       ...
 *    }; 
 *
 *    @return {boolean}
 *    this.hasNext = function() { // return true if it still has numbers
 *       ...
 *    };
 * };
 */

/**
 * @param {Iterator} iterator
 */
var PeekingIterator = function(iterator) {
    this.iterator = iterator;
    this.cache = null;
};

/**
 * @return {number}
 */
PeekingIterator.prototype.peek = function() {
    if(this.cache !== null) return this.cache;
    var cache = this.iterator.next();
    this.cache = cache;
    return cache;
};

/**
 * @return {number}
 */
PeekingIterator.prototype.next = function() {
    if(this.cache !== null) {
        var cache = this.cache;
        this.cache = null;
        return cache;
    }
    return this.iterator.next();
};

/**
 * @return {boolean}
 */
PeekingIterator.prototype.hasNext = function() {
    if(this.cache !== null) return true;
    return this.iterator.hasNext();
};

/** 
 * Your PeekingIterator object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * var obj = new PeekingIterator(arr)
 * var param_1 = obj.peek()
 * var param_2 = obj.next()
 * var param_3 = obj.hasNext()
 */
```

## Approach
The idea of this problem is to implement a new iterator method `peek()` using the existing iterator `iterator`, which has two methods `next()` and `hasNext()`. By implementing the constructor function `PeekingIterator` and instantiating it with the `new` keyword, we can achieve this goal. We need to implement the `next()`, `hasNext()`, and `peek()` methods on the prototype chain of the `PeekingIterator` constructor. We store the reference of the `iterator` object in the `iterator` property when creating the instance. We also initialize and set the `cache` property to `null`. First, we implement the `peek()` method. When this method is called, we first retrieve the `next` value of the iterator object and then write it to the `cache` property before returning the value. Then, we implement the `next()` method. We first check if the `cache` is `null`. If there is a cached value, we set the cache to `null` and return the cached value. If there is no cached value, we simply call the `next()` method of the iterator. Similarly, for the implementation of the `hasNext()` method, we first check if there is a cached value. If there is a cached value, we consider that the iteration is not yet complete. If there is no cached value, we call the `hasNext()` method of the iterator to determine if there are more elements.
