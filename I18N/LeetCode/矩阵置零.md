# Zero Matrix
Given an `m x n` matrix, if an element is `0`, set its entire row and column to `0` in place.

## Example

```
Input:
[
  [1,1,1],
  [1,0,1],
  [1,1,1]
]
Output:
[
  [1,0,1],
  [0,0,0],
  [1,0,1]
]
```
```
Input:
[
  [0,1,2,0],
  [3,4,5,2],
  [1,3,1,5]
]
Output:
[
  [0,0,0,0],
  [0,4,5,0],
  [0,3,1,0]
]

```

## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} matrix
 * @return {void} Do not return anything, modify matrix in-place instead.
 */
var setZeroes = function(matrix) {
    var row = new Set();
    var column = new Set();
    matrix.forEach( (line, i) => {
        line.forEach( (v, k) => {
            if(v === 0) {
                row.add(i);
                column.add(k);
            }
        })
    } )
    matrix.forEach( (line, i) => {
        line.forEach( (v, k) => {
            if( row.has(i) || column.has(k) ) matrix[i][k] = 0;
        })
    } )
};
```

## Idea
A relatively simple solution is used here. First, two `Set`s are set up to record the row numbers and column numbers that need to be zeroed. Then the matrix is traversed, and if a value in the matrix is `0`, the row number and column number of that value are respectively recorded in the two `Set`s. Then the entire matrix is traversed again, and if the row number or column number of the value is in the `Set`, the value in the matrix is set to `0`, achieving in-place zeroing.
