# Adding Strings
Given two non-negative integers `num1` and `num2` in string form, calculate their sum.  
Note:  
* The length of `num1` and `num2` are both less than `5100`.
* `num1` and `num2` only contain numbers `0-9`.
* `num1` and `num2` do not contain any leading zeros.
* You cannot use any built-in `BigInteger` library, nor can you directly convert the input strings into integer form.

## Example
```
Input: num1 = 990, num2 = 10
Output: 1000
```

## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} num1
 * @param {string} num2
 * @return {string}
 */
var addStrings = function(num1, num2) {
    var diff = Array(Math.abs(num1.length - num2.length)).fill(0).join("");
    if(num1.length > num2.length) num2 = diff + num2;
    else num1 = diff + num1;
    var target = "";
    var n = num1.length;
    var carry = 0;
    for(let i=n-1; i>=0; --i){
        let num = ~~(num1[i]) + ~~(num2[i]) + carry;
        if(num >= 10) {
            carry = 1;
            num -= 10;
        }else{
            carry = 0;
        }
        target = num + target;
    }
    if(carry) target = "1" + target;
    return target;
};
```

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} num1
 * @param {string} num2
 * @return {string}
 */
var addStrings = function(num1, num2) {
    var p1 = num1.length-1;
    var p2 = num2.length-1;
    var target = "";
    var carry = 0;
    while(p1>=0 || p2>=0 || carry!==0){
        if(p1>=0) carry += ~~(num1[p1--]);
        if(p2>=0) carry += ~~(num2[p2--]);
        target = (carry%10) + target;
        carry = ~~(carry / 10);
    }
    return target;
};
```

## Idea
My initial idea was to pad `0` to align the numbers, then add each digit from right to left. Use `carry` as the carry flag and `target` as the target string. After padding with `0`, go through the loop, convert each character of the two strings to `int`, add them with the carry, check if the sum is greater than 10 for carry, and concatenate the result to the target string. If there is a carry at the end, append `1` to the target string. Later, using the double pointer approach, the code becomes more concise. Again, use `carry` as the carry flag and the increment value, and `target` as the target string. No need to pad with `0` for alignment, the loop condition is satisfied if either of the two pointers is greater than or equal to `0`, or if there is a carry. Determine whether to add its value to the increment `carry` by checking if the pointer value is greater than or equal to `0`, then concatenate the modulo of the increment to the target string, take the increment divided by `10` as the carry flag, and finally return the target string.
