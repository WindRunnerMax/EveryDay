# Issues and Solutions Related to Browser Extension Development
I'm thrilled to share that the installation count for my browser extension has finally surpassed a thousand! On [Firefox AddOns](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/force-copy/), it has reached `1.7k+` installs, while on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/force-copy/cceclgeciefpanebkfkogecbjjchmico), it's over `1k+` installs. In fact, the statistics on the Firefox extension market reflect weekly average installations, and the actual installs on any given day tend to exceed this average significantly. As for the Chrome extension market, installation numbers become inaccurate after surpassing `1k`, meaning there are likely more than `1k` actual installs.

Before developing the extension, I had implemented a script to handle related functionalities, which has garnered `2,688k+` installs on [GreasyFork](https://greasyfork.org/zh-CN/scripts/405130). There were two main reasons for creating the extension: Firstly, I wanted to learn about extension development, as I found that there were real-world applications at work, especially when needing to bypass browser limitations for specific tasks. Secondly, I discovered that some code I had packaged and published on `GreasyFork` under the `GPL` license was repurposed into a plugin that included ads, and it surprisingly amassed `400k+` installs.

Hence, I utilized my scripting skills to develop this browser extension, primarily for learning purposes. I built the entire development environment from scratch and addressed numerous compatibility issues. Next, let's delve into the related challenges and their solutions. You can find the project repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/WindrunnerMax/TKScript); if you enjoy it, please give it a `star`! 😁 

## Extension Packaging Strategies
As mentioned earlier, we built the development environment from the ground up, which necessitated choosing a packaging tool for the extension. I opted for `rspack`, although using `webpack` or `rollup` would also work fine. I prefer `rspack` because I'm more familiar with it and it offers faster build times. The configuration is quite similar across all packaging tools. It's also worth noting that we are using a `build` level packaging approach here, and the `devserver` option in `v3` isn't particularly suitable at this time.

A key point to remember while developing a browser extension is that we need to define multiple entry files with a single-file packaging scheme. We should avoid having multiple `chunks` for a single entry. This applies to `CSS` files as well; they should be packaged as a single entry with a single output. Moreover, the output filenames should not include `hash` suffixes to prevent issues with locating files. However, this is not a major concern if you pay attention to your configuration.

```js
module.exports = {
  context: __dirname,
  entry: {
    popup: "./src/popup/index.tsx",
    content: "./src/content/index.ts",
    worker: "./src/worker/index.ts",
    [INJECT_FILE]: "./src/inject/index.ts",
  },
  // ...
  output: {
    publicPath: "/",
    filename: "[name].js",
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, folder),
  },
}
```

Here, you'll notice that the output filename for `INJECT_FILE` is dynamic. Since the `inject` script needs to be injected into the browser page, conflicts may arise due to the injection approach. As a result, the filenames generated during each `build` will differ, and they will change with every release. The naming for simulated event communication is also uniquely generated each time.

```js
const EVENT_TYPE = isDev ? "EVENT_TYPE" : getUniqueId();
const INJECT_FILE = isDev ? "INJECT_FILE" : getUniqueId();

process.env.EVENT_TYPE = EVENT_TYPE;
process.env.INJECT_FILE = INJECT_FILE;
// ...

module.exports = {
  context: __dirname,
  builtins: {
    define: {
      "__DEV__": JSON.stringify(isDev),
      "process.env.EVENT_TYPE": JSON.stringify(process.env.EVENT_TYPE),
      "process.env.INJECT_FILE": JSON.stringify(process.env.INJECT_FILE),
      // ...
    }
  }
  // ...
}
```

## Chrome and Firefox Compatibility
`Chrome` has been strongly pushing for the `V3` version of extensions, which means `manifest_version` needs to be specified as `3`. However, submitting a version with `manifest_version: 3` in `Firefox` will trigger a warning against its usage. Personally, I also prefer not to use the `v3` version due to its numerous restrictions, making it difficult to implement many functionalities properly; we can discuss this further later. Since `Chrome` mandates the use of `v3` while `Firefox` recommends `v2`, we need to establish a compatibility solution for both the `Chromium` core and the `Gecko` core.

In fact, this resembles a multi-platform build scenario, where we need to package the same code for multiple platforms. When dealing with cross-platform compilation issues, my go-to method has been using `process.env` and `__DEV__`. However, I found that using conditional compilation this way, with extensive `process.env.PLATFORM === xxx` checks, can easily lead to deep nesting issues, negatively impacting readability. After all, our `Promise` exists to address the problem of asynchronous callback hell; introducing further nested issues due to cross-platform compilation doesn't seem like a wise solution.

In `C/C++`, there's an interesting preprocessor known as the `C Preprocessor`, which isn’t part of the compiler but acts as a separate step in the compilation process. Simply put, the `C Preprocessor` is like a text replacement tool, where macro parameters without identifiers directly replace raw text, guiding the compiler to complete the necessary pre-processing before actual compilation. Directives like `#include`, `#define`, and `#ifdef`, among others, belong to the preprocessor's directives. Here, we primarily focus on the conditional compilation aspects, such as `#if`, `#endif`, `#ifdef`, `#endif`, `#ifndef`, and `#endif`.

```c
#if VERBOSE >= 2
  print("trace message");
#endif

#ifdef __unix__ /* __unix__ is usually defined by compilers targeting Unix systems */
# include <unistd.h>
#elif defined _WIN32 /* _WIN32 is usually defined by compilers targeting 32 or 64 bit Windows systems */
# include <windows.h>
#endif
```

We can implement a similar method using build tools. The `C Preprocessor` operates as a pre-processing tool that does not partake in the actual compilation process, making it quite similar to a `loader` in `webpack`. The direct replacement of raw text can also be fully achieved within `loader`. We can use comments to simulate directives like `#ifdef` and `#endif`, effectively avoiding deep nesting issues. Moreover, we can directly modify the string replacement logic; for instance, removing lines that don’t meet platform conditions while retaining those that do – achieving effects similar to `#ifdef` and `#endif`. Additionally, using comments can assist in complex scenarios, I've encountered instances involving intricate `SDK` packaging where internal and external behaviors differ significantly, making cross-platform setups challenging without multiple builds. Users may need to configure build tools themselves, but using comments can allow for complete packaging without needing to adjust `loader` configurations, thus alleviating the need for users to modify their settings in certain cases. However, this is still closely tied to specific business scenarios and serves merely as a reference.

```js
// #IFDEF CHROMIUM
console.log("IS IN CHROMIUM");
// #ENDIF

// #IFDEF GECKO
console.log("IS IN GECKO");
// #ENDIF
```

Initially, I considered using regex for direct processing, but I found it quite cumbersome, especially with nested cases, where logic becomes harder to manage. Eventually, I realized that since the code is structured line by line, handling it on a per-line basis is the most efficient approach. Particularly since they are comments, which will ultimately be deleted, even if there’s indentation, we can simply trim the whitespace to match tags for processing. This streamlined my approach significantly; the pre-processing directive starting with `#IFDEF` will remain `true`, and the terminating `#ENDIF` will switch it to `false`. Our ultimate goal is merely to delete certain code sections, so we can return blank for non-qualifying lines. However, while handling nesting, it's vital to maintain a stack to track the indices of current processing directives’ start `#IFDEF` when they push onto the stack, and pop them off when encountering `#ENDIF`. We also need to keep track of the current processing state; if it's `true` upon popping, we must determine if we need to mark it as `false` to conclude processing for that block. Plus, we can utilize `debug` to generate files post-processing specific modules.

```js
// CURRENT PLATFORM: GECKO

// #IFDEF CHROMIUM
// some expressions... // remove
// #ENDIF

// #IFDEF GECKO
// some expressions... // retain
// #ENDIF
```

```
// #IFDEF CHROMIUM
// some expressions... // remove
// #IFDEF GECKO
// some expressions... // remove
// #ENDIF
// #ENDIF

// #IFDEF GECKO
// some expressions... // retain
// #IFDEF CHROMIUM
// some expressions... // remove
// #ENDIF
// #ENDIF

// #IFDEF CHROMIUM|GECKO
// some expressions... // retain
// #IFDEF GECKO
// some expressions... // retain
// #ENDIF
// #ENDIF
```

```js
// ...
// Control whether this line hits the preprocessing conditions during iteration
const platform = (process.env[envKey] || "").toLowerCase();
let terser = false;
let revised = false;
let terserIndex = -1;
/** @type {number[]} */
const stack = [];
const lines = source.split("\n");
const target = lines.map((line, index) => {
// Remove leading and trailing whitespace, remove the line's leading comment symbols and whitespace (optional)
const code = line.trim().replace(/^\/\/\s*/, "");
// Check for the start of a preprocessing directive `#IFDEF`, which will only set `true`
if (/^#IFDEF/.test(code)) {
  stack.push(index);
  // Continue if it's `true`
  if (terser) return "";
  const match = code.replace("#IFDEF", "").trim();
  const group = match.split("|").map(item => item.trim().toLowerCase());
  if (group.indexOf(platform) === -1) {
    terser = true;
    revised = true;
    terserIndex = index;
  }
  return "";
}
// Check for the end of a preprocessing directive `#ENDIF`, which will only set `false`
if (/^#ENDIF$/.test(code)) {
  const index = stack.pop();
  // Ignore extra `#ENDIF`
  if (index === undefined) return "";
  if (index === terserIndex) {
    terser = false;
    terserIndex = -1;
  }
  return "";
}
// If it hits the preprocessing conditions, erase it
if (terser) return "";
  return line;
});
// ...
```

In practical usage, taking the registration of `Badge` as an example, you can execute the respective code for different platforms by using `if` branches. Certainly, if there are similar definitions, you can easily redefine the variables directly.

```js
let env = chrome;
// #IFDEF GECKO
if (typeof browser !== "undefined") {
  env = browser;
}
// #ENDIF
export const cross = env;

// ...
let action: typeof cross.action | typeof cross.browserAction = cross.action;
// #IFDEF GECKO
action = cross.browserAction;
// #ENDIF
action.setBadgeText({ text: payload.toString(), tabId });
action.setBadgeBackgroundColor({ color: "#4e5969", tabId });
```

## Execute Before Page Js Code
One key feature of browser extensions is `document_start`, meaning that the code injected by the browser executes before the site's own `Js` code. This provides ample `Hook` space for our code. Consider the potential if we could run the `Js` code we wanted right as the page loads; we could manipulate the current page at will. Although we can't `Hook` the creation of literal objects, we can always call the APIs provided by the browser. As long as we invoke the `API`, we can find ways to intercept function calls and retrieve the data we desire. For instance, we could intercept the call to `Function.prototype.call`, and for this function to work effectively, it needs to be supported by our intercepting function first across the entire page. Otherwise, if this function has already been called, intercepting again would be pointless.

```js
Function.prototype.call = function (dynamic, ...args) {
  const context = Object(dynamic) || window;
  const symbol = Symbol();
  context[symbol] = this;
  args.length === 2 && console.log(args);
  try {
    const result = context[symbol](...args);
    delete context[symbol];
    return result;
  } catch (error) {
    console.log("Hook Call Error", error);
    console.log(context, context[symbol], this, dynamic, args);
    return null;
  }
};
```

So we might all wonder what the significance of this code implementation is. Let's take a simple example: in a certain library, all text is rendered through a `canvas`. Since there is no `DOM`, if we want to obtain the entire content of the document, we cannot directly copy it. A feasible solution is to hijack the `document.createElement` function. When the created element is a `canvas`, we can grab the canvas object in advance to obtain the `ctx`. Moreover, since the actual rendering of text still requires calling the `context2DPrototype.fillText` method, by hijacking this method, we can extract the rendered text. Following that, we can create the `DOM` elsewhere, thus allowing for copying whenever we want.

Now, returning to the implementation of this issue, if we can ensure that the script runs first, we can accomplish nearly anything on the language level, such as modifying the `window` object, hooking function definitions, altering prototype chains, blocking events, and so forth. This capability ultimately stems from browser extensions, and the challenge for the script manager is how to expose this capability of browser extensions to `Web` pages. For our discussion, let's assume user scripts run on the browser page as `Inject Scripts` rather than `Content Scripts`. Based on this assumption, we are likely to write a dynamic/asynchronous loading implementation for `JS` scripts, similar to the following:

```js
const loadScriptAsync = (url: string) => {
    return new Promise<Event>((resolve, reject) => {
        const script = document.createElement("script");
        script.src = url;
        script.async = true;
        script.onload = e => {
            script.remove();
            resolve(e);
        };
        script.onerror = e => {
            script.remove();
            reject(e);
        };
        document.body.appendChild(script);
    });
};
```

Now, there's a clear problem: if we load the script after the `body` tag has been constructed, roughly at the `DOMContentLoaded` moment, we will definitely not achieve the goal of `document-start`. Even handling it after the `head` tag is complete is not effective, as many websites include some `JS` resources within the `head`. Loading it at that timing is also unsuitable. In reality, the biggest issue is still that the entire process is asynchronous — by the time the external script finishes loading, a lot of `JS` code has already executed, preventing us from achieving our goal of “executing first.”

So let's explore the specific implementation. First is the `v2` extension for browsers using the `gecko` engine. For the entire page, the first element to load is definitely the `html` tag. It’s clear that we just need to insert the script at the `html` tag level. Coupling this with the `chrome.tabs.executeScript` for dynamic code execution within the browser extension's `background` and the `Content Script`'s `"run_at": "document_start"` to establish message communication confirming the injected `tab`, this method may seem very simple. Yet, this seemingly straightforward problem had me pondering for quite some time on how to achieve it.


```js
// Content Script --> Background
// Background -> chrome.tabs.executeScript
chrome.tabs.executeScript(sender.tabId, {
  frameId: sender.frameId,
  code: `(function(){
    let temp = document.createElementNS("http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml", "script");
        temp.setAttribute('type', 'text/javascript');
        temp.innerHTML = "${script.code}";
        temp.className = "injected-js";
        document.documentElement.appendChild(temp);
        temp.remove();
    }())`,
  runAt,
});
```

This approach actually looks quite good; it can basically achieve `document-start`. However, since we're saying it's only basic, it indicates that there are still some scenarios where issues may arise. If we take a closer look at the implementation of this code, there is a communication occurring which is `Content Script --> Background`. Since this is communication, it involves asynchronous processing, and because it's asynchronous, it will take time. Once time is consumed, the user’s page might have already executed a significant amount of code, making it occasionally impossible to truly achieve `document-start`, resulting in the script potentially failing to execute.

So, how can we address this issue? In `v2`, we can clearly understand that `Content Script` is entirely controlled with `document-start`, but `Content Script` is not the same as `Inject Script` and cannot access the page's `window` object. Therefore, it cannot effectively hijack the functions on the page. This problem appears complex, but once understood, the solution can actually be quite simple. We can build on the original `Content Script` by introducing an additional `Content Script`, the code of which is entirely equivalent to the original `Inject Script`, but it will be attached to `window`. We can utilize a packaging tool to write a plugin to accomplish this.

```js
compiler.hooks.emit.tapAsync("WrapperCodePlugin", (compilation, done) => {
  Object.keys(compilation.assets).forEach(key => {
    if (!isChromium && key === process.env.INJECT_FILE + ".js") {
      try {
        const buffer = compilation.assets[key].source();
        let code = buffer.toString("utf-8");
        code = `window.${process.env.INJECT_FILE}=function(){${code}}`;
        compilation.assets[key] = {
          source() {
            return code;
          },
          size() {
            return this.source().length;
          },
        };
      } catch (error) {
        console.log("Parse Inject File Error", error);
      }
    }
  });
  done();
});
```

This piece of code indicates that we have attached a randomly generated `key` to the same `window` object of the `Content Script`. This is where we previously mentioned potential conflicts might occur, and the content is actually the script we wish to inject into the page. However, although we can now access this function, how can we ensure it executes on the user’s page? Here, we utilize the same `document.documentElement.appendChild` method to create the script. The implementation here is exceptionally clever: by using two `Content Scripts` in combination with `toString`, we obtain a string which is then directly injected into the page as code, thereby achieving true `document-start`.


```js
const fn = window[process.env.INJECT_FILE as unknown as number] as unknown as () => void;
// #IFDEF GECKO
if (fn) {
  const script = document.createElementNS("http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml", "script");
  script.setAttribute("type", "text/javascript");
  script.innerText = `;(${fn.toString()})();`;
  document.documentElement.appendChild(script);
  script.onload = () => script.remove();
  // eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/ban-ts-comment
  // @ts-ignore
  delete window[process.env.INJECT_FILE];
}
// #ENDIF
```

As previously mentioned, the `Chrome` browser no longer permits submissions of `v2` extensions, meaning we can only submit `v3` code. However, `v3` code comes with very strict Content Security Policy (CSP) restrictions, effectively disallowing the dynamic execution of code. Thus, the approaches we've outlined above become ineffective, leading us to write something akin to the following code.

```js
const script = document.createElementNS("http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml", "script");
script.setAttribute("type", "text/javascript");
script.setAttribute("src", chrome.runtime.getURL("inject.js"));
document.documentElement.appendChild(script);
script.onload = () => script.remove();
```

Although it seems that we are immediately creating a `Script` tag in the `Content Script` and executing code, can this achieve our `document-start` goal? Unfortunately, the answer is no. While it works when the page is first opened, subsequently this script effectively behaves as an external script. Consequently, `Chrome` queues this script alongside the other scripts on the page, and due to strong caching, it’s uncertain which script will execute first. This instability is unacceptable, thus we definitely cannot meet the `document-start` objective. 

In fact, this alone indicates that `v3` is not fully mature; many capabilities are not adequately supported. In response, the official team later devised several solutions to tackle this problem. However, given that we have no way to determine the user's browser version, many compatibility methods still need to be addressed.

```js
export const implantScript = () => {
  /**  RUN INJECT SCRIPT IN DOCUMENT START **/
  // #IFDEF CHROMIUM
  // https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=634381
  // https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75495191/chrome-extension-manifest-v3-how-to-use-window-addeventlistener
  if (cross.scripting && cross.scripting.registerContentScripts) {
    logger.info("Register Inject Scripts By Scripting API");
    // https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/scripting/registerContentScripts
    cross.scripting
      .registerContentScripts([
        {
          matches: [...URL_MATCH],
          runAt: "document_start",
          world: "MAIN",
          allFrames: true,
          js: [process.env.INJECT_FILE + ".js"],
          id: process.env.INJECT_FILE,
        },
      ])
      .catch(err => {
        logger.warning("Register Inject Scripts Failed", err);
      });
  } else {
    logger.info("Register Inject Scripts By Tabs API");
    // https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/tabs/onUpdated
    cross.tabs.onUpdated.addListener((_, changeInfo, tab) => {
      if (changeInfo.status == "loading") {
        const tabId = tab && tab.id;
        const tabURL = tab && tab.url;
        if (tabURL && !URL_MATCH.some(match => new RegExp(match).test(tabURL))) {
          return void 0;
        }
        if (tabId && cross.scripting) {
          cross.scripting.executeScript({
            target: { tabId: tabId, allFrames: true },
            files: [process.env.INJECT_FILE + ".js"],
            injectImmediately: true,
          });
        }
      }
    });
  }
  // #ENDIF
  // #IFDEF GECKO
  logger.info("Register Inject Scripts By Content Script Inline Code");
  // #ENDIF
};
```

Since `Chrome V109`, support for `chrome.scripting.registerContentScripts` has been introduced, and `Chrome 111` allows scripts declared with `world: 'MAIN'` directly in the `Manifest`. However, compatibility issues still need to be handled by developers, especially when older browsers do not support `world: 'MAIN'`, in which case the script will be treated as a `Content Script`. I find this aspect somewhat challenging to manage.

## Handling Static Resources
Consider that many of our resource references are processed as strings, such as the `icons` reference in `manifest.json`, which is a string reference rather than referencing resources based on their actual paths as we would in our `Web` applications. In such instances, the resources will not be incorporated as content by the packaging tool. The specific issue is that modifying resources does not trigger the `HMR` of the packaging tool.

Therefore, for this part, we need to manually integrate these into the bundle dependencies. Additionally, it is necessary to copy the relevant files to the target packaging folder. This task is not overly complex; we simply need to create a plugin to accomplish this. Besides handling images and other static resources, we also need to manage `locales` as language files.

```js
exports.FilesPlugin = class FilesPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.make.tap("FilesPlugin", compilation => {
      const resources = path.resolve("public/static");
      !compilation.contextDependencies.has(resources) &&
        compilation.contextDependencies.add(resources);
    });

    compiler.hooks.done.tapPromise("FilesPlugin", () => {
      const locales = path.resolve("public/locales/");
      const resources = path.resolve("public/static/");

      const folder = isGecko ? "build-gecko" : "build";
      const localesTarget = path.resolve(`${folder}/_locales/`);
      const resourcesTarget = path.resolve(`${folder}/static/`);

      return Promise.all([
        exec(`cp -r ${locales} ${localesTarget}`),
        exec(`cp -r ${resources} ${resourcesTarget}`),
      ]);
    });
  }
};
```

## Generating Manifest
As previously mentioned regarding the handling of static resources, there is a similar issue with the generation of the `manifest.json` file. We also need to register it as a `contextDependency` with the bundler. Additionally, recalling that we need to maintain compatibility with both `Chromium` and `Gecko`, we similarly need to ensure that `manifest.json` is compatible. To avoid having two configuration files for this purpose, we can utilize `ts-node` to dynamically generate `manifest.json`. This allows us to write the configuration file dynamically through various logic.

```js
exports.ManifestPlugin = class ManifestPlugin {
  constructor() {
    tsNode.register();
    this.manifest = path.resolve(`src/manifest/index.ts`);
  }

  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.make.tap("ManifestPlugin", compilation => {
      const manifest = this.manifest;
      !compilation.fileDependencies.has(manifest) && compilation.fileDependencies.add(manifest);
    });

    compiler.hooks.done.tapPromise("ManifestPlugin", () => {
      delete require.cache[require.resolve(this.manifest)];
      const manifest = require(this.manifest);
      const version = require(path.resolve("package.json")).version;
      manifest.version = version;
      const folder = isGecko ? "build-gecko" : "build";
      return writeFile(path.resolve(`${folder}/manifest.json`), JSON.stringify(manifest, null, 2));
    });
  }
};
```

```js
const __URL_MATCH__ = ["https://*/*", "http://*/*", "file://*/*"];
```

```javascript
// Chromium
const __MANIFEST__: Record<string, unknown> = {
  manifest_version: 3,
  name: "Force Copy",
  version: "0.0.0",
  description: "Force Copy Everything",
  default_locale: "en",
  icons: {
    32: "./static/favicon.128.png",
    96: "./static/favicon.128.png",
    128: "./static/favicon.128.png",
  },
  // ...
  permissions: ["activeTab", "tabs", "scripting"],
  minimum_chrome_version: "88.0",
};

// Gecko
if (process.env.PLATFORM === "gecko") {
  __MANIFEST__.manifest_version = 2;
  // ...
  __MANIFEST__.permissions = ["activeTab", "tabs", ...__URL_MATCH__];
  __MANIFEST__.browser_specific_settings = {
    gecko: { strict_min_version: "91.1.0" },
    gecko_android: { strict_min_version: "91.1.0" },
  };

  delete __MANIFEST__.action;
  delete __MANIFEST__.host_permissions;
  delete __MANIFEST__.minimum_chrome_version;
  delete __MANIFEST__.web_accessible_resources;
}

module.exports = __MANIFEST__;
```

## Event Communication Scheme
In browser extensions, there are many modules, commonly including `background/worker`, `popup`, `content`, `inject`, `devtools`, etc. Each module serves a different purpose and collaborates to enhance the functionality of the extension. Clearly, due to the various modules, each responsible for distinct functions, we need to establish communication capabilities among the related modules.

Since the entire project is built with `TS`, we aim to implement a fully typed communication scheme, particularly during complex functional implementations where static type checking can help us avoid numerous issues. Here, we take `Popup` to `Content` as an example to create a unified data communication solution, requiring us to design relevant classes for each module that needs to communicate within the extension.

First, we need to define the communication `key` values, as we must use the `type` to determine the information type conveyed in the communication. To prevent value conflicts, we increase the complexity of our `key` values using `reduce`.

```js
const PC_REQUEST_TYPE = ["A", "B"] as const;
export const POPUP_TO_CONTENT_REQUEST = PC_REQUEST_TYPE.reduce(
  (acc, cur) => ({ ...acc, [cur]: `__${cur}__${MARK}__` }),
  {} as { [K in typeof PC_REQUEST_TYPE[number]]: `__${K}__${typeof MARK}__` }
);
```

If we've used `redux`, we might encounter a challenge regarding how to align the `type` with the type carried by the `payload`. For example, we may want `TS` to automatically infer that when `type` is `A`, the `payload` type is `{ x: number }`, and when `type` is `B`, the inferred type should be `{ y: string }`. A relatively straightforward declarative example would be as follows:

```js
type Tuple =
  | {
      type: "A";
      payload: { x: number };
    }
  | {
      type: "B";
      payload: { y: string };
    };
    
const pick = (data: Tuple) => {
  switch (data.type) {
    case "A":
      return data.payload.x; // number
    case "B":
      return data.payload.y; // string
  }
};
```

However, this approach is not very elegant; we might prefer a more refined declaration of types. Fortunately, we can utilize generics to accomplish this. Nonetheless, we may need to tackle the problem gradually, first by establishing a type `Map` for `type -> payload`, representing the mapping relationship. After that, we can transform this into a structure of `type -> { type: T, payload: Map[T] }`, from which we can derive `Tuple`.


```js
type Map = {
  A: { x: number };
  B: { y: string };
};

type ToReflectMap<T extends string, M extends Record<string, unknown>> = {
  [P in T]: { type: unknown extends M[P] ? never : P; payload: M[P] };
};

type ReflectMap = ToReflectMap<keyof Map, Map>;

type Tuple = ReflectMap[keyof ReflectMap];
```

Now, we can encapsulate this within a `namespace` along with some basic methods for type conversion to make it easier for us to call.

```js
export namespace Object {
  export type Keys<T extends Record<string, unknown>> = keyof T;

  export type Values<T extends Record<symbol | string | number, unknown>> = T[keyof T];
}

export namespace String {
  export type Map<T extends string> = { [P in T]: P };
}

export namespace EventReflect {
  export type Array<T, M extends Record<string, unknown>> = T extends string
    ? [type: unknown extends M[T] ? never : T, payload: M[T]]
    : never;

  export type Map<T extends string, M extends Record<string, unknown>> = {
    [P in T]: { type: unknown extends M[P] ? never : P; payload: M[P] };
  };

  export type Tuple<
    T extends Record<string, string>,
    M extends Record<string, unknown>
  > = Object.Values<Map<Object.Values<T>, M>>;
}

type Tuple = EventReflect.Tuple<String.Map<keyof Map>, Map>;
```

In fact, to facilitate our function calls, we can also process the parameters by casting them internally to the required parameter types.

```js
type Map = {
  A: { x: number };
  B: { y: string };
};

type Args = EventReflect.Array<keyof Map, Map>;

declare function post(...args: Args): null;

post("A", { x: 2 });
post("B", { y: "" });
```

To clarify our type expressions, we will temporarily avoid using function parameter syntax. Instead, we'll denote types using an object format of `type -> payload`. Since we have already defined the types for the requests here, we now need to define the data types for the returned responses in a similar `type -> payload` format. The response `type` matches the request `type`.

```js
type EventMap = {
  [POPUP_TO_CONTENT_REQUEST.A]: { [K in PCQueryAType]: boolean };
};

export type PCResponseType = EventReflect.Tuple<String.Map<keyof EventMap>, EventMap>;
```

Next, we will define the entire event communication `Bridge`. Since we are sending data from `Popup` to `Content`, we must specify which `Tab` we are sending data to, thus necessitating the inquiry of the currently active `Tab`. The data communication method will use `cross.tabs.sendMessage`, while receiving messages will involve `cross.runtime.onMessage.addListener`. Given the potential variety of communication channels, we also need to check the message source, which can be done by assessing the sent `key`.

It is important to note that even though the extended definition includes `sendResponse` for asynchronous data responses, testing reveals that this function cannot be called asynchronously. This means it must be executed immediately within the callback. The term asynchronous here refers to the overall event communication process, so we'll define it in terms of immediate data response.

```js
export class PCBridge {
  public static readonly REQUEST = POPUP_TO_CONTENT_REQUEST;
```

```typescript
static async postToContent(data: PCRequestType) {
  return new Promise<PCResponseType | null>(resolve => {
    cross.tabs
      .query({ active: true, currentWindow: true })
      .then(tabs => {
        const tab = tabs[0];
        const tabId = tab && tab.id;
        const tabURL = tab && tab.url;
        if (tabURL && !URL_MATCH.some(match => new RegExp(match).test(tabURL))) {
          resolve(null);
          return void 0;
        }
        if (!isEmptyValue(tabId)) {
          cross.tabs.sendMessage(tabId, data).then(resolve);
        } else {
          resolve(null);
        }
      })
      .catch(error => {
        logger.warning("Send Message Error", error);
      });
  });
}

static onPopupMessage(cb: (data: PCRequestType) => void | PCResponseType) {
  const handler = (
    request: PCRequestType,
    _: chrome.runtime.MessageSender,
    sendResponse: (response: PCResponseType | null) => void
  ) => {
    const response = cb(request);
    response && response.type === request.type && sendResponse(response);
  };
  cross.runtime.onMessage.addListener(handler);
  return () => {
    cross.runtime.onMessage.removeListener(handler);
  };
}

static isPCRequestType(data: PCRequestType): data is PCRequestType {
  return data && data.type && data.type.endsWith(`__${MARK}__`);
}
```

Furthermore, communication between `content` and `inject` requires a somewhat specialized encapsulation. The `DOM` and event flow in `Content Scripts` are shared with the `Inject Script`, which means we can effectively implement communication in two ways:
* The first common method is using `window.addEventListener + window.postMessage`. However, one obvious issue with this approach is that messages can also be received in the `Web` page. Although we can generate random `tokens` to validate the source of the messages, this method can still be easily intercepted by the page itself, which is not very secure.
* Another approach is utilizing `document.addEventListener + document.dispatchEvent + CustomEvent` to create custom events. Here, it's crucial to ensure that the event names are random. By generating a unique random event name in the `background` during the injection of the framework, and subsequently using that event name for communication between the `Content Script` and the `Inject Script`, we can prevent the messages generated from method calls from being intercepted by users.

It is important to note that all transmitted data types must be serializable. If not, they will be considered cross-origin objects in `Gecko`-based browsers, as they genuinely cross different `Contexts`. Otherwise, it would be akin to directly sharing memory.

```js
// Content Script
document.addEventListener("xxxxxxxxxxxxx" + "content", e => {
    console.log("From Inject Script", e.detail);
});

// Inject Script
document.addEventListener("xxxxxxxxxxxxx" + "inject", e => {
    console.log("From Content Script", e.detail);
});
```

```js
// Inject Script
document.dispatchEvent(
    new CustomEvent("xxxxxxxxxxxxx" + "content", {
        detail: { message: "call api" },
    }),
);

// Content Script
document.dispatchEvent(
    new CustomEvent("xxxxxxxxxxxxx" + "inject", {
        detail: { message: "return value" },
    }),
);
```

## Hot Update Solution
Earlier, we discussed the various limitations of Google's heavily promoted `v3`. One significant restriction is its `CSP - Content Security Policy`, which no longer allows for the dynamic execution of code. This means that tools like our `DevServer's` `HMR` cannot function properly, while hot updates are a feature we actually need. Consequently, we are left with less refined solutions.

We can create a plugin for our build tool that uses `ws.Server` to start a `WebSocket` server. Then, we can establish a connection from `worker.js`, the `Service Worker` we intend to start, to this `WebSocket` server. By using `new WebSocket`, we can connect and listen for messages. Upon receiving a `reload` message from the server, we will execute `chrome.runtime.reload()` to reload the extension.

In the active `WebSocket` server, we need to send a `reload` message to the client after each build completion, for example, within the `afterDone` hook. This will allow for simple extension reload capabilities. However, this introduces another problem: in the `v3` version, `Service Workers` are not persistent. Therefore, the `WebSocket` connection will also be terminated along with the destruction of the `Service Worker`. This has caused many `Chrome` extensions to struggle with transitioning smoothly from `v2` to `v3`, and it is likely that this capability will be improved in the future.

```js
exports.ReloadPlugin = class ReloadPlugin {
  constructor() {
    if (isDev) {
      try {
        const server = new WebSocketServer({ port: 3333 });
        server.on("connection", client => {
          wsClient && wsClient.close();
          wsClient = client;
          console.log("Client Connected");
        });
      } catch (error) {
        console.log("Auto Reload Server Error", error);
      }
    }
  }
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.afterDone.tap("ReloadPlugin", () => {
      wsClient && wsClient.send("reload-app");
    });
  }
};
```

```js
export const onReceiveReloadMsg = () => {
  if (__DEV__) {
    try {
      const ws = new WebSocket("ws://localhost:3333");
      // Reload upon receiving a message
      ws.onmessage = () => {
        try {
          CWBridge.postToWorker({ type: CWBridge.REQUEST.RELOAD, payload: null });
        } catch (error) {
          logger.warning("SEND MESSAGE ERROR", error);
        }
      };
    } catch (error) {
      logger.warning("CONNECT ERROR", error);
    }
  }
};

export const onContentMessage = (data: CWRequestType, sender: chrome.runtime.MessageSender) => {
  logger.info("Worker Receive Content Message", data);
  switch (data.type) {
    case CWBridge.REQUEST.RELOAD: {
      reloadApp(RELOAD_APP);
      break;
    }
    // ...
  }
  return null;
};
```

Here we have successfully implemented the entire hot update solution for the extension. At this point, we can leverage the extension's `Install` event to re-execute the `Content/Inject Script` code injection at this moment, thereby achieving a comprehensive hot update for the extension. Of course, we must ensure that the script injection is idempotent. It is important to note that there is no `Uninstall` event in the extension, so we need to manage the removal of previously injected side effects through the convention of calling specific global methods.

```js
const onSetup = () => {
  cross.tabs.query({}).then(tabs => {
    for (const tab of tabs) {
      const tabId = tab && tab.id;
      cross.scripting.executeScript(/** ... */);
      cross.tabs.executeScript(tabId, /** ... */)
    }
  });
};
cross.runtime.onInstalled.addListener(/** ... */);
```

## Popup Multilingual Support
Interestingly, the multilingual solution provided by the browser is not very effective. The files we store in `locals` are merely placeholders, intended to let the extension marketplace recognize the languages supported by our browser extension. The actual multilingual implementation occurs within our `Popup`. For example, the data in `packages/force-copy/public/locales/zh_CN` looks like this:

```js
{
  "name": {
    "message": "Force Copy"
  }
}
```

In reality, there are many front-end multilingual solutions available. Here, since our extension does not contain much multilingual content to worry about—after all, it is just a `Popup` layer—there is no need to create a separate `index.html` page. However, if that were necessary, it would be worthwhile to adopt a community multilingual solution. For now, we will keep it simple.

First, we ensure complete type coverage. In our extension, we use English as the base language, so the configuration is also set in English. Since we want a better grouping scheme, there may be more deeply nested structures. Therefore, the type definition must be comprehensive to support our multilingual requirements.

```js
export const en = {
  Title: "Force Copy",
  Captain: {
    Modules: "Modules",
    Start: "Start",
    Once: "Once",
  },
  Operation: {
    Copy: "Copy",
    Keyboard: "Keyboard",
    ContextMenu: "ContextMenu",
  },
  Information: {
    GitHub: "GitHub",
    Help: "Help",
    Reload: "Reload",
  },
};
```

```js
export type DefaultI18nConfig = typeof en;

export type ConfigBlock = {
  [key: string]: string | ConfigBlock;
};
type FlattenKeys<T extends ConfigBlock, Key = keyof T> = Key extends string
  ? T[Key] extends ConfigBlock
    ? `${Key}.${FlattenKeys<T[Key]>}`
    : `${Key}`
  : never;
export type I18nTypes = Record<FlattenKeys<DefaultI18nConfig>, string>;
```

Next, we define the `I18n` class along with a global cache for languages. In the `I18n` class, we implement functions for calling, generating multilingual configurations on demand, and retrieving multilingual configurations. When calling it, we instantiate with `new I18n(cross.i18n.getUILanguage());` and can retrieve translations by calling `i18n.t("Information.GitHub")`.

```js
const cache: Record<string, I18nTypes> = {};

export class I18n {
  private config: I18nTypes;
  constructor(language: string) {
    this.config = I18n.getFullConfig(language);
  }

  public t = (key: keyof I18nTypes, defaultValue = "") => {
    return this.config[key] || defaultValue || key;
  };
```

```typescript
  private static getFullConfig = (key: string) => {
    if (cache[key]) return cache[key];
    let config;
    if (key.toLowerCase().startsWith("zh")) {
      config = this.generateFlattenConfig(zh);
    } else {
      config = this.generateFlattenConfig(en);
    }
    cache[key] = config;
    return config;
  };

  private static generateFlattenConfig = (config: ConfigBlock): I18nTypes => {
    const target: Record<string, string> = {};
    const dfs = (obj: ConfigBlock, prefix: string[]) => {
      for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(obj)) {
        if (isString(value)) {
          target[[...prefix, key].join(".")] = value;
        } else {
          dfs(value, [...prefix, key]);
        }
      }
    };
    dfs(config, []);
    return target as I18nTypes;
  };
}
```

## Conclusion
Developing browser extensions is quite a complex endeavor, especially when it needs to be compatible with both `v2` and `v3`. Many design considerations must be made to ensure functionality on `v3`. The shift to `v3` has reduced some flexibility, but it has also enhanced security to some extent. However, the inherent permissions of browser extensions remain significantly high; for instance, even in `v3`, we can still utilize `CDP - Chrome DevTools Protocol` on `Chrome` to accomplish a wide array of tasks. There is an overwhelming number of capabilities that extensions can offer, making it daunting to install them without a clear understanding or when the source code is not open. High extension permissions can lead to severe issues, such as user data leaks. Even with a strict code upload requirement like that of `Firefox` to tighten review processes, it is challenging to eliminate all potential risks.
