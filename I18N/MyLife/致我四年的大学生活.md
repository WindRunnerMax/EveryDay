# Address to my four years of university life

I'm someone who really enjoys listening to stories. I think life is just about two things: listening to other people's stories and telling your own story. So, let me tell you about my university story.

My four years of university life were neither particularly good nor bad; it was just plain and ordinary. Perhaps everyone's life is just plain and ordinary, and only a few have extraordinary experiences. I'm just sharing my experiences here. If there's anything inappropriate, please take it as a warning. If it benefits you in any way, I would be greatly honored. If you'd like to continue reading, then welcome to my world.

Time flies, and four years have passed in the blink of an eye, and it's finally time for me to graduate. Looking back at these four years, it's been a journey with ups and downs. As I reminisce about these four years of life, the memories feel like a dream and I treasure them deeply.

Let's go back to July 2016, when I was filling out my university applications. My college entrance exam score was 572 points, which meant that I could just about get into Shandong University of Science and Technology. Back then, I wasn't very familiar with the various majors at the school, so I just picked a few to apply for. When the admission results came out, the admission score for my major at Shandong University of Science and Technology was 568, and I exceeded the admission mark by only four points. I was also transferred to another major, and finally got into the industrial design program. As someone with an artistic flair (pardon my boasting), I was sure that I would do well in design.

Later, I didn't have much to do at home, so I joined some online groups. I honed my typing speed and gradually learned touch typing. I also collected a bunch of emojis. I have to admit that these groups did serve a purpose; I quickly became acquainted with my classmates. Apart from being in these groups, I also spent my time playing games with my childhood friend at home. We mainly played two games: "Metal Slug" and "Red Alert," and managed to play them throughout the entire holiday without getting bored. I also got to know the school a bit better, using Google Earth to see the location of the school and some panoramic images. At the time, I felt that the school was really big and surrounded by greenery, even though it was a bit out of the way. However, this didn't bother me much because I didn't usually go out to play, hah, and that's how I spent a lazy holiday before finally starting school.

When the school started, I have to say, the traffic was really terrible. The road was so congested, especially at the junction on Bayuwan Road. It took a lot of effort to finally reach the south gate entrance. I was amazed at how big the entrance of the school was. And as I walked into the campus, I felt like it was really vast. It took quite a long walk before I arrived at the freshmen registration point at J1 gate. Then, a senior warmly helped me carry my luggage and led me to the B10 dormitory building. Later, we arranged the dormitory and prepared some daily necessities. After that, I went to have a bowl of lamb soup with my family. From then on, my college life at Shandong University of Science and Technology officially began.

The first lesson in college was military training. We were really sunburnt by the scorching sun. Speaking of which, I have to mention my roommate Lao Pu. He was already tanned from learning to drive during the holiday, and after military training, he looked even darker, hah. Looking at the pictures from those years, I couldn't help but sigh at how young we were.

In my freshman year, I had a very enriching college life. So, I joined two clubs: the university-level Science and Technology Association and the Art Department at the college. At the Science and Technology Association, I got to know students from various departments across the school and learned a lot of technical skills. I learned how to solder with an electric iron, fix computers, crimp network cables, disassemble and clean computers, and even started a side business repairing computers. Also, because I interacted with students from various majors, I saw them all learning C language. That inspired me to learn a bit of C language as well. At the Art Department, I truly experienced the hard work involved in behind-the-scenes work. Our department often hosted events, and each event required a lot of preparation and cleanup afterward. Working behind the scenes was truly not easy. Later, when I bragged about my experiences, I could proudly say that I had worked at the Art Department. However, joining these clubs really required a lot of time and effort. Having two clubs meant attending two weekly meetings. After evening self-study sessions, I had to go to these meetings, which often lasted until late. Also, on weekends, when my roommates were still sleeping, I had to organize various activities or attend to other matters. So, joining student clubs has its pros and cons. But if you ask me now, with my current laziness, I would prefer to just lie in the dorm and sleep all day, hah.

While other freshmen hadn't started taking major courses, we had already taken many professional courses, such as sketching and color design. We had five classes a week for these courses. Although they were relatively easy, I still had to attend. Also, as I lived in B10 and the classes were held in the J14 building on the 6th floor, every trip to the art studio felt like a pilgrimage. In addition, I also joined two student association departments, and I always felt like I had a lot to do. That wasn't what I expected after hearing that university would be all about fun. Anyone who says that to me now, I'd immediately argue with them.

When I hit the second semester of my freshman year, it was probably the busiest time for me throughout my entire first year. Not only did I already have a lot of major courses, but I also had to take an extra class, and the workload became ridiculously overwhelming. The assignments required meticulous attention, as making even a tiny mistake could mean having to redo the entire thing. It was a real headache for me at the time. As soon as that class was over, there was another one involving a field trip to Dunhuang, Gansu to visit the Mogao Caves. Unfortunately, just as this was happening, I received notification about the possibility of changing my major. I decided to pursue this opportunity, which turned out to be a real headache. The entrance exam for the new major included advanced calculus and computer fundamentals, and I had previously only studied the first half of the 'C' version of calculus, and struggled through the exam because I didn't know any of the material. On the other hand, the computer fundamentals were relatively easier, allowing for some quick learning.

I then went to the library and borrowed a slim book on the C programming language and another one on computer architecture. Looking back, I can't believe I chose those books at that time. It wasn't until later, when I was actually studying the course, that I realized how difficult the subject was. It was in that moment that I truly questioned my decision to borrow that particular book. To be honest, at that time, I had wanted to change my major to the Internet of Things because I thought it was very cool. However, the IoT major wasn't accepting transfers at that time, so I ended up choosing computer science and technology. I consider myself lucky because only 30 students transferred to the computer science major that year, just enough to form a new class. Anyone who wanted to change majors to computer science was accepted, and for others, like me, it would have been very difficult to pass the transfer exam based on my previous major's 35th percentile ranking and my level of calculus knowledge. However, in the following year, the transfer exam for computer science students in the 2017 cohort was changed to a C language test. I was not worried about taking the exam in C language, as at least it was much simpler than calculus.

After successfully changing my major, the rest of that semester became one of the most relaxed periods for me, without having to worry about failing courses. However, I still needed to catch up on several computer science courses and self-study linear algebra, advanced calculus, C language, and C++. It felt really challenging. Then, during the winter vacation, when I moved dorms, my previous classmates from the original major each helped me carry my belongings to my new dorm room, which was a great help. Although I moved to a new dorm, I still often went back to the old dorms to take showers together when we had the free time.

During the summer vacation of my freshman year, my friends and I went to help in rural areas through the "Three Visits" program. I joined the Yantai branch of our technology department and we brought many parts to fix various electronic appliances such as electric kettles, electric frying pans, washing machines, and more. It started off as a part-time job repairing computers and turned into a part-time job fixing household appliances, but we still had a great time together.

After completing the "Three Visits" program, I returned home to learn how to drive. If you're wondering why I didn't learn to drive during the summer vacation right after the college entrance examination, it's because I was not yet 18 years old and was not allowed to register for the driving school. So, I had to wait until the winter vacation of my freshman year to sign up and pass the first part of the exam with a perfect score. During this vacation, I had to complete the second part and also learn to drive for a little over a week. My driving instructor saw that concentrating on just one part of the exam during that holiday was a bit challenging, so he suggested that I take both the second and third parts together. He then planned my schedule in such a way that I practiced the third part in the morning and the second part in the afternoon, for almost two weeks. Finally, we scheduled both the second and the third parts of the exam consecutively. On the first day, I took the second part of the exam, followed by the third part the next day. I was quite nervous at that point, but fortunately, I passed both exams on the first attempt. After that, I quickly booked the fourth part and managed to complete it before the start of the next semester. On the last day of my break, my driver's license was conveniently delivered, and I had successfully completed the process of getting my driver's license, even though I hadn't made much progress in studying advanced calculus. I was frankly struggling to understand it.

In the first semester of my sophomore year, I officially began studying computer science, which marked a crazy new beginning. Up until then, I had only studied subjects like philosophy, Marxism, modern history, Maoist theory, English, and the like. But now, it was time to make up for the missed courses, including advanced calculus, general physics, linear algebra, experimental physics, C language, C++, and discrete mathematics, among others. My daily routine pretty much became fixed - attending classes in the morning, spending the rest of the day studying and working on assignments, and occasionally taking a nap after lunch. There was simply a pile of assignments to complete for many courses, and it was quite overwhelming. I actually kept a course schedule that I had cherished for a long time, and when combined with the elective courses I took on weekends, it amounted to exactly 25 class periods per week. In reality, I had even more than 30 class periods per week, but due to scheduling conflicts, I had to negotiate with the instructors to resolve the issues. Sometimes, when I couldn't attend a class, I had to explain the situation to the teachers. Overall, at that time, it felt like I was repeating my high school years all over again.

Following the semester was the winter vacation, during which I worked on a project under the guidance of a teacher. This was my first project, and although I was primarily in charge of the front-end, I also got to learn about some backend and front-end interactions. Since the dormitory was closed during the holidays, I stayed in the accommodation of a graduate student until the Chinese New Year. During this time, I actually began to delve into software development.

##大二下学期基本上也就是补课的状态，就是整天上课然后做作业，真的是刺激，下学期参加了中国软件杯，比赛的题目是Activiti国产化迁移与应用实践，就是将开源项目Activiti迁移到国产龙芯CPU环境并且拓展功能，我和zzc以及wfb三个人组队参加了这次比赛。由于我和wfb俩人都需要补课，所以前期工作基本上都是zzc完成的，太强了一神带二坑带我们打进了复赛，复赛结果出来了基本上就快放假了，暑假就得留校做比赛，接下来才是我们三个人的比赛哈哈，就不能光被带了，还是得干点活的，这次比赛学习了不少东西，SSM框架、数据库、Linux基本命令、小程序的开发、Git多人协作开发等等，还使用到了国产的龙芯CPU服务器以及操作系统。如果说做第一个项目是入门的话，那么这次比赛带给我的就是真正的进行软件开发了，当然由于本身技术水平并不高，开发出来的软件可能只能达到能用的程度，可维护性与性能方面可能都比较差。还记得光录视频就录了好十几次，半夜起来改代码，然后经历了几次作品的提交，终于来到了决赛，去南京住酒店，住酒店真的是爽，早餐是自助餐，然后去比赛的时候也是二十块钱一顿饭的标准，点的不够还给补饮料喝，真爽，然后在完成了最后一次答辩之后，我们成功地拿到了国家一等奖，我觉得这可能是我能拿到的最高的一个奖了。

为了打比赛暑假就回家了不到两个周，在家的时候比较无聊就学了学ThinkPHP5，用框架写PHP那感觉就是不一样，不再是纯面向过程了，也有了面向对象的感觉。等到回到学校那就是酷暑，在学校的暑假确实是热的一批，虽然实验室有空调但是吹不到我哈哈，在暑假里我还给自己定了一个小目标，我想之后的大学生活经济自己自足，经济独立，然后研一买辆车，目标总要是有的，万一实现了呢。

###大三的上学期

*课是真的少，就从大二的疯狂补课突然转变成了没啥课可上，就整个感觉很无聊，然后我就开始了我的副业：做外包，整个时候暑假学的ThinkPHP就派上了用场，首先是自己做的一个卖优惠券的网站，因为之前也做过网站的项目，只是以短期使用为目的的话这个网站并不难做，但这个网站最难顶的地方在于对接支付，支付的对接流程真的是比较复杂，看文档看的我有点蒙。第一次对接支付对接了我好久，最后终于把这整个流程弄明白了，然后第一版的订单支付终于完成了，光这就弄了我两天，因为我这个人没有对接支付的资质，就一直在找第四方支付去对接，来来回回换了好几个支付接口，不过有了第一次的经验后边换别的的支付对接就比较简单了。再之后就接了小程序的项目，虽然比赛期间做了小程序，但是我做的并不多，现在正好这个就当我练手了，当然这个是受ly之托做的，并没有收费，练手项目也不好意思收费哈哈。再就是真正的开始接外包项目了，现在主要都是做微信小程序了，现在做微信小程序已经比较熟练了，当然这个时候也只是会用原生的方式去写，模块化组件化等还不熟悉，然后又到了喜闻乐见的对接支付环节了，本来我认为我以前对接过支付应该做的挺快，可是我发现是我太天真了，我又被卡住了，主要是卡在了那个最后的验证签名那一步上，怎么验签都不对，直到那天下午我直接把key等全部重置了，然后就神奇的验签成功了，迷之操作啊，有时候写代码就是玄学。

###时间到了寒假

*这个寒假玩的是很不爽的，想着开学要开始考研就浑身难受，在家是不可能学习的，但是在家里也属实没啥事干，于是打算投投简历找找工作玩玩。于是简单地制作了一份简历，在Boss直聘上投递了几家青岛本地的公司，当然基本都是小公司，我就一直在跟HR他们聊的还不错，当时感觉还是挺好玩的，直到我投递了一些相对比较大的厂，简历犹如石沉大海，再无声息。

**大三下学期开学了

*就得开始考研了，这个学期课还贼多，就比较烦，有一天上完了课，想找个教室上自习，找了半天也没找到个自习室，强智的智校园App也没法用了，进不去，之前我通过抓包弄清楚了为什么智校园会崩溃，这是一个没考虑到高并发的设计缺陷。虽然我知道问题所在但一直也就将就用着，现在我忍不了了，我这想起来chd之前找的Api，于是我就回宿舍自己封装了一个网页，套壳的App去替代智校园的功能，虽然当时用户并不多，只有几百位用户，但是我感觉这个确实是可以做下去的，尤其是因为某种原因下学校关闭了外网访问而我搞了一手内网穿透的时候，用户量激增啊。有一次跟ly还有lgj同学去小珠山玩的时候，ly建议我做微信小程序，于是我在上课也抱着电脑的情况下花了两天时间做了第一版的山科小站小程序，对了这个山科小站的名字也是ly同学取得哈哈，之后便是不断地维护修改拓展功能。虽然这段时间应该是考研的时间，但我还是挺不务正业的，这期间我还投了一些公司，我还自不量力地投了一下阿里，连简历关都没过去，还是内推，在现在看来当时真的是有点自不量力，因为现在在深入学习了前端之后才真的明白当时是啥都不会，本来还自我感觉良好来着哈哈，现在想来当时要是像wfb那样深入学习一门语言才是正道啊。**

**暑假留校考研了，

*暑假前段时间在原来宿舍学习，宿舍就我和老朴俩人。再到后来他去北京了，我也回家了，回家呆了十几天，回学校继续学习，我们几个人在S1大教室备考，不得不说S1大教室真的是一个神奇的地方，冬冷夏热，当时是哪里都热，本来做题就浑身热，教室也热，宿舍也热，热热热热热热。

School officially started at the end of August, and now it's already the first semester of my senior year. During this time, I haven't been watching videos, going out without my phone, or writing code. My computer has gathered a layer of dust over the past few months. I've actually been sleeping a lot, waking up at eight every day. In the morning, I usually study math until around noon when I go for lunch. By the time I get back to the dorm, it's already one o'clock. I then spend half an hour on my phone, take a nap for an hour and a half, and then head off to study my professional courses at three. After that, I usually have dinner around six, and when I'm done eating, I watch political videos and then spend an hour working on 1000 political science questions. I also do an English reading exercise, look up words on Ah Xiang's phone, and write them down in my notebook. I sleep a lot, but because I don't bring my phone with me, I feel pretty productive. I find that whenever I start studying, I want to do everything. In addition to my daily study routine, I'm already planning what I want to do after finishing my postgraduate studies, such as learning Vue and relearning Java, and rewriting Shanke Xiaozhan, etc. When it came time to apply for the postgraduate entrance exam, I was really hesitant. Computer science is just too competitive. So, I opted to play it safe and apply to my current university. During the postgraduate entrance exam, I was really nervous. They were so strict with security, like scanning you at the J1 entrance, not allowing any keys or campus cards inside, and scanning you again at the exam room door. It was much stricter than the college entrance exam. After completing my postgraduate studies, I spent a couple of days playing around at school. Originally, I planned to go out with my dorm mates, but after the exam, everyone was too lazy to move and just stayed in the dorm.

When I got home, even though the winter vacation officially began, I didn't fully accomplish my plan. I only refactored the code for Shanke Xiaozhan, learned Vue, some machine learning-related stuff, created an app, watched two movies, and followed a TV series. After that, the epidemic came, the school opening date kept getting postponed, and finally, the results of the postgraduate exam were released. I scored 65 in political science, 84 in English, 88 in math, and 138 in professional courses for a total of 375. I never thought I would score this much. This year, due to the epidemic, many more students were admitted for postgraduate studies, so the admission scores of various schools were relatively lower. It really feels like I made a bad choice sticking with my current university. In fact, it’s a huge mistake. I can only console myself that since I've already made this choice, I should just keep going and the experience has made me realize that I underestimated myself. After that, it was a long holiday. I started my habit of doing daily practice questions. I really learned a lot from WFB and LZF’s advice about learning a language more deeply. I decided my future direction would be in front-end development because I am more familiar with it. Every day, I solved one problem, mostly interview questions, and turned each one into a blog post. It's a great way to delve deeply into learning and to serve as reference material for future use.

The second semester of my senior year started unusually late. I returned to school on June 6th, and there were hardly any people there. Although I hadn't been at school for so long, my bed linen was unchanged, everything was the same. A few of us had fun together for some time, and then I started working for Boss Zhou for a few days. Finally, on the 20th, the out-of-town classmates returned. After completing the nucleic acid test, they basically returned to the dormitory on the same day or on the 21st. On the 22nd, the classmates from within the province also returned to the dormitory. The dormitory was finally full. This year's graduation season was really rushed. On the morning of the 23rd, there was a graduation ceremony, and in the afternoon, we took graduation photos in our original classrooms. In the evening, we had a small gathering in our dorm. On the 24th morning, we took graduation photos in the college, and in the afternoon, we took photos in the classroom. In the evening, we had another small reunion in 616 dormitory. On the 25th, my big brother and Mr. Hou went back home, and on the 26th, everyone went home. The graduation season ended inadvertently and in a hurry. By this time, I had also achieved one of my small goals, which was to be financially independent from the summer vacation of my sophomore year to now. As for the slightly more challenging goal of buying a car in my first year of postgraduate study, I will do my best. Wishing all my friends a bright future and looking forward to meeting again in happiness.

Year after year, it should have been a beautiful and good time, but now it seems to be just an illusion. Even if there are a thousand different moods, who else can I tell? ---2020.06.26 07:53.
