# Core Interaction Strategy of Browser Selection Model
As mentioned earlier, the design of the data model is the foundation module of the editor, directly influencing the representation of the selection module. The design of the selection module is also a fundamental part of the editor. When the application of the editor changes, the expression of the operation scope requires implementation based on the selection model. In other words, the meaning represented by the selection is for the editor to perceive in what range the change commands should be executed.

## Browser Selection
The design of the data model directly influences the expression of the editor's selection model. For example, the `Quill` and `Slate` editor's model selection implementations in the following examples are closely related to the data structures they maintain. However, regardless of the editor's design data model, it needs to be implemented based on the browser's selection, so in this article, we will first implement the basic operations of the browser selection model.

```js
// Quill
{ index: 0, length: 3 }

// Slate
{ 
  anchor: { offset: 0, path: [0, 0] }, 
  focus: { offset: 3, path: [0, 0] } 
} 
```

In reality, the concept of selection is quite abstract, but we should be dealing with it frequently. For example, when dragging part of the text content with the mouse, that part will carry a light blue background, which represents the range of the selection. Similarly, we may refer to it as selected, dragged blue, selected range, and so on; this is the selection capability provided by the browser.

In addition to the blue background of the selected text, the blinking cursor is also a form of selection representation. The selection range of the cursor is a point, or can be referred to as a collapsed selection. The cursor representation usually only appears in editable elements, such as input boxes, text areas, `ContentEditable` elements, etc. If in a non-editable element, the cursor is in an invisible state, but it still exists in reality.

The operations of the browser selection mainly rely on the `Range` and `Selection` objects. The `Range` object represents a fragment of the document containing nodes and partial text nodes, while the `Selection` object represents the text range selected by the user or the current position of the cursor symbol.

### Range
The `Range` object is similar to the mathematical concept of an interval, meaning it represents a continuous content range. Mathematically, an interval can be represented by two points, similarly, the expression of the `Range` object is from `startContainer` to `endContainer`, so the selection must be continuous to be properly represented. The properties of a `Range` instance object are as follows:

- `startContainer`: Represents the starting node of the selection.
- `startOffset`: Represents the starting offset of the selection.
- `endContainer`: Represents the ending node of the selection.
- `endOffset`: Represents the ending offset of the selection.
- `collapsed`: Indicates whether the start and end positions of the `Range` are the same, i.e., the collapsed state.
- `commonAncestorContainer`: Represents the common ancestor node of the selection, the node that fully contains `startContainer` and `endContainer` at the deepest level.

The `Range` object also has many methods, with the most commonly used in our editor being setting the start position of the selection `setStart`, setting the end position `setEnd`, and getting the rectangle position of the selection `getBoundingClientRect`. In the example below, we can obtain the position of the text fragment `23`:

```html
<span id="$1">123456</span>
<script>
  const range = document.createRange();
  range.setStart($1.firstChild, 1);
  range.setEnd($1.firstChild, 3);
  console.log(range.getBoundingClientRect());
</script>
```

Getting the rectangle position of a text fragment is a very important application, this way we can achieve getting the position of incomplete `DOM` elements, without necessarily having to obtain rectangle positions through the `HTML DOM`, which is very useful for implementing effects like word highlighting. Additionally, it's important to note that the `firstChild` here is a `Text` node, with the value being of type `Node.TEXT_NODE`, to calculate the text fragment.

Since textual nodes can be set, naturally there are also states for non-textual nodes. When calling to set a selection, if the node types are `Text`, `Comment`, or `CDATASection`, then the `offset` refers to the character offset from the end node. For other node types, the `offset` refers to the offset of the child nodes from the end node.

In the example below, what we are doing is setting the selection range to a node that is not a text content. In this case, the outermost `$1` node acts as the parent node, with `2` child nodes. Therefore, the `offset` can be set within the range of `0-2`. If it is set to `3` at this point, an exception will be thrown directly. Here, it is similar to setting the `offset` for a text selection, but the difference is that for a text selection, it must be a text node, while for a non-text selection, it is the parent node.

```html
<span id="$1"><span>123</span><span>456</span></span>
<script>
  const range = document.createRange();
  range.setStart($1, 1);
  range.setEnd($1, 2);
  console.log(range.getBoundingClientRect());
</script>
```

The main purpose of constructing a `Range` object is to obtain the position of related `DOM` elements for calculation. Another common requirement is to implement content highlighting. Usually, this requires us to actively calculate positions to create a virtual layer. In newer browsers, the `::highlight` pseudo-element has been implemented, which allows us to achieve highlighting effects using the browser's native implementation. In the example below, the text fragment `23` will appear with a background color.

```html
<span id="$1">123456</span>
<style>
  ::highlight(highlight-bg) {
    color: white;
    background-color: blue;
  }
</style>
<script>
  const range = document.createRange();
  range.setStart($1.firstChild, 1);
  range.setEnd($1.firstChild, 3);
  const highlightBG = new Highlight();
  highlightBG.add(range);
  CSS.highlights.set("highlight-bg", highlightBG);
</script>
```

### Selection
The `Selection` object represents the text range selected by the user or the current position of the cursor, which represents a text selection on the page that may span multiple elements. In reality, the `Selection` in the browser is composed of `Range` objects. The main properties of the `Selection` object are as follows:

- `anchorNode`: represents the starting node of the selection.
- `anchorOffset`: represents the starting offset of the selection.
- `focusNode`: represents the ending node of the selection.
- `focusOffset`: represents the ending offset of the selection.
- `isCollapsed`: indicates whether the starting and ending positions of the selection are the same, i.e., collapsed state.
- `rangeCount`: indicates the number of `Range` objects included in the selection.

Users may select text from left to right or from right to left. The `anchor` points to where the user begins the selection, while the `focus` points to where the user ends the selection. The concepts of `anchor` and `focus` should not be confused with the starting position `startContainer` and ending position `endContainer` of the selection. The `Range` object always points from the `start` node to the `end` node.

- Anchor: The anchor of a selection refers to the starting point of the selection. When selecting an area with the mouse, the anchor is where the mouse was clicked. The anchor remains fixed as the user drags the mouse.
- Focus: The focus of a selection refers to the end point of the selection. When selecting an area with the mouse, the focus is where the mouse was released. The position of the focus changes as the user drags the mouse.

We can listen for changes in the selection by using the `selectionchange` event. In the event callback for selection changes, we can retrieve the current selection object state using `window.getSelection()`. The selection instance obtained with `getSelection` is a singleton object, meaning the reference is to the same instance, but its internal values change.

Although the `W3C` standard does not strictly require a singleton, major browsers such as `Chrome`, `Firefox`, and `Safari` implement it as a single instance. However, for compatibility and to handle `null` states, when we actually need to use the selection object, we typically get the selection state in real-time through `getSelection`. Additionally, the properties of the `Selection` object are not enumerable, and the spread operator is not valid.

```js
document.addEventListener("selectionchange", () => {
  const selection = window.getSelection();
  console.log({
    anchor: selection.anchorNode,
    anchorOffset: selection.anchorOffset,
    focus: selection.focusNode,
    focusOffset: selection.focusOffset,
    isCollapsed: selection.isCollapsed,
  });
});
```

In an editor, it's essential to handle selection operations. This can be achieved using the `addRange` method of the `Selection` object, typically preceded by using the `removeAllRanges` method to clear any existing selection. It's important to note that this method cannot handle selections in a backward direction.

```html
<span id="$1">123456</span>
<script>
  const range = document.createRange();
  range.setStart($1.firstChild, 1);
  range.setEnd($1.firstChild, 3);
  const selection = window.getSelection();
  selection.removeAllRanges();
  selection.addRange(range);
</script>
```

Therefore, when setting selections, it's common practice to use `setBaseAndExtent` to achieve this. For forward selections, simply set the `start` and `end` directions of the nodes as `base` and `extent`. For backward selections, set the `start` and `end` directions of the nodes as `extent` and `base`, thus achieving the effect of a backward selection. The parameters for `DOM` nodes are essentially the same as those for `Range`.

```html
<span id="$1">123456</span>
<script>
  const selection = window.getSelection();
  selection.setBaseAndExtent($1.firstChild, 3, $1.firstChild, 1);
</script>
```

The setting of selections can be achieved through the above-mentioned APIs. While it is possible to obtain selections using `focus` and `anchor`, the `backward` state is not explicitly marked on the `Selection` object. Therefore, it is necessary to use the `getRangeAt` method to retrieve the built-in `Range` object inside the selection to compare it with the original object's state.

The `rangeCount` property on the `Selection` object indicates the number of `Range` objects contained within the selection. Typically, only the first selection needs to be retrieved. Special attention needs to be paid to the conditional check here because if there is no current selection, i.e., when `rangeCount` is `0`, attempting to retrieve the built-in selection object directly will result in an exception.

Moreover, you may wonder why the `rangeCount` property exists when we usually only select a single continuous range. It is worth noting that in `Firefox`, multiple selections can be made by holding down the `Ctrl` key. For better browser compatibility, however, handling the first selection is usually sufficient.

```html
<span id="$1">123456</span>
<script>
  const selection = window.getSelection();
  selection.setBaseAndExtent($1.firstChild, 3, $1.firstChild, 1);
  if (selection.rangeCount > 0) {
    const range = selection.getRangeAt(0);
    const rect = range.getBoundingClientRect();
    console.log(rect);
  }
</script>
```

Selection handling also offers an interesting control effect. Normally, a `ContentEditable` element should be selected as a whole, with its internal text nodes appearing as selected. If there is a need to prevent the selection of text content, the `user-select` property can be used for this purpose. As selections rely on edges of nodes, a special disjointed selection effect can be achieved.

Additionally, in the following example, `childNodes` is used instead of `children` to access the status of child nodes. While `childNodes` retrieves a collection of all child nodes, including text nodes, comments, etc., `children` only retrieves a collection of element nodes. Therefore, extra care is needed when setting selections.

```html
<span id="$1">12<span style="user-select: none;">34</span>56</span>
<script>
  const selection = window.getSelection();
  selection.setBaseAndExtent($1.childNodes[0], 1, $1.childNodes[2], 1);
</script>
```

Lastly, we introduced the `::highlight` pseudo-element in relation to `Range` objects. Here, we also introduce the `::selection` pseudo-element. `::selection` is used to apply styles to the portion of text selected by the user. By setting styles for `::selection`, such as background color and font color, control over the selection's appearance can be achieved.

Here's an intriguing scenario – when developing browser extensions or scripts, if there is a need to restore the original background color for the `::selection` pseudo-element, setting it to `transparent` is not effective. This would result in the disappearance of the selection's background color. In fact, the default light blue background is retained by using the keyword `highlight`, though using a color like `#BEDAFF` is also viable.

```html
<span id="$1">123456</span>
<style>
  span::selection{
    background: blue;
    color: white;
  }
</style>
<script>
  const selection = window.getSelection();
  selection.setBaseAndExtent($1.firstChild, 1, $1.firstChild, 3);
</script>
```

## Editable Element
Although selections are not directly related to editable elements, our goal is to implement a rich text editor, so we need to handle the selection state within `ContentEditable` elements. But before that, let's first focus on basic selection operations for `input` elements.

```html
<input id="$1" value="123456" />
<script>
  $1.focus();
  $1.setSelectionRange(1, 3);
</script>
```

Next, let's look at the implementation in a `ContentEditable` element. Essentially, the selection operation doesn't vary whether it's an editable element or not. In editable elements, the cursor is explicitly visible, also known as the insertion point. In non-editable elements, although the cursor is invisible, selection events and movements are still real.

```html
<span id="$1" contenteditable>123456</span>
<script>
  const selection = window.getSelection();
  selection.setBaseAndExtent($1.firstChild, 3, $1.firstChild, 1);
</script>
```

Initially, I wanted to create a pure `Blocks` editor. Currently, I haven't found a good editor implementation to reference, mainly because similar editors are complex, making it hard to understand without relevant articles. Back then, I was more inclined towards the `quill-delta` data structure because of its excellent support for collaboration and well-structured representation of `diff` and `ops`.

Therefore, the initial idea was to implement nested `Blocks` using multiple `Quill Editor` instances. However, this approach comes with several challenges, requiring the disabling of many default editor behaviors and reimplementation. For instance, managing `History`, `Enter` for line breaks, selection transformations, etc., which indicates numerous points to focus on. Compared to building an editor from scratch, dealing with various browser compatibility events and handling input events, this management approach seemed acceptable.

One important aspect to consider here is that a `Blocks` editor inherently requires a nested data structure to describe content. It's possible to design the editor with initially flat `Block` structures, storing `string[]` block node information for each `Block` for references. If the editor design doesn't favor nested structures but content refers to block structures, then those blocks can be incorporated into the `Editor` instance, although this approach is predominantly tied to rich text frameworks, impacting extensibility.

A `Blocks` editor is entirely managed by the outermost `Block` structure for reference relationships where references are within the `children`. On the other hand, a block-referencing editor needs to handle reference relationships within the editor itself, with references within the `ops`. Therefore, the design and implementation of the data structure heavily depend on the overall architecture of the editor. Viewing block-referencing editors as single-entry `Blocks` editors, where `Editor` instances handle all line expressions, helps identify commonalities despite differing designs.

During the actual editor implementation, I noticed clear selection strategies in browsers. In the example below, under `State 1` of a `ContentEditable` status, it's impossible to select from `Selection Line 1` to `Selection Line 2`. This default selection behavior by browsers renders it impractical to implement `Blocks` based on this model.

```html
<p>State 1</p>
<div contenteditable="false" data-block>
  <div contenteditable="true" data-line>Selection Line 1</div>
  <div contenteditable="true" data-line>Selection Line 2</div>
</div>
```

In `Stage 2`, the model state allows normal selection operations with no model-related issues. However, at this point, we encounter selection problems with `Quill` due to its initialization causing a mutation from `<br/>` to `div/p` states, resulting in incorrect cursor positions in the browser.

Without the ability to intervene in `Quill` to correct selections and lacking any DOM markers to assist in selection corrections, continuing this approach becomes challenging. Even handling state changes would require intrusion into `parchment`'s view implementation, necessitating more complex processing.

```html
<p>State 2</p>
<div contenteditable="true" data-block>
  <div contenteditable="true" data-line>Selection Line 1</div>
  <div contenteditable="true" data-line>Selection Line 2</div>
</div>
```

Therefore, in this state, we may only be able to adopt the form of the `Stage 3` strategy, not implementing full `Blocks`, but using `Quill` as an embedded structure editor instance. In this model state, the editor will not encounter selection offset issues, and our nested structure can also leverage `Quill`'s `Embed Blot` for plugin extension with nested `Block` structures.

```html
<p>State 3</p>
<div contenteditable="true" data-block>
  <div data-line>Selection Line 1</div>
  <div data-line>Selection Line 2</div>
  <div contenteditable="false" data-block>
    <div contenteditable="true" data-line>Selection Line 1</div>
    <div contenteditable="true" data-line>Selection Line 2</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

In this scenario, to achieve the target of the `Blocks` editor using `Quill`, it can only rely on the `Embed Blot` pattern for implementation. However, this is entirely dependent on the view layer maintained by `Quill`. Handling boundary cases would require further handling of the view layer with `parchment`, making it very cumbersome, which is also a part of the reason for implementing the editor from scratch.

Similar issues exist in `editor.js` as well. In its online `DEMO`, we find that we cannot select from pure text line `1` to line `2`. Specifically, after selecting part of the text in line `1` and dragging to select part of the text in line `2`, lines `1` and `2` will both be entirely selected. The `Yoopta-Editor` implemented based on `slate` has a similar problem.

This issue does not exist in the Feishu document editor. In the Feishu document, the key point is that the selection area must be within the same parent `Block`. The specific implementation is that when the mouse is pressed and dragged, it is in an entirely uncontrolled state. If it collides with another block, the internal selection style will be overridden by `::selection`, and then the overall style of the block will apply the selected style with a `class`.

When releasing the mouse, the selection state will be immediately corrected to truly be within the same parent block. Being in the same block simplifies operations, whether applying changes or retrieving data from the selected segments. Iterating within the same parent block eliminates the need to recursively search based on the rendering block order, making data processing simpler.

```html
<div>
  <div class="level1">
    <div class="level2.1">
      <div class="level3.1" id="$nodeA"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="level2.2">
      <div class="level3.1">
        <div class="level4.1" id="$nodeB"></div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<script>
  const getNodeDepth = (node) => {
    let depth = 0;
    let current = node;
    while (current.parentNode) {
      depth++;
      current = current.parentNode;
    }
    return depth;
  };

  const liftNode = (node1, node2) => {
    const depth1 = getNodeDepth(node1);
    const depth2 = getNodeDepth(node2);

    let [deepNode, shallowNode] = depth1 > depth2 ? [node1, node2] : [node2, node1];

    for (let i = Math.abs(depth1 - depth2); i > 0; i--) {
      deepNode = deepNode.parentNode;
    }
```

```html
While `deepNode` is not the same as `shallowNode`, the function keeps moving up the DOM tree from each node until they share a common parent. This process helps identify a common ancestor of the two nodes and returns the deep node, shallow node, and their parent when found. If no common ancestor is found, null values are returned for all three nodes.

The section below discusses the concept of custom selections in DOM elements. Typically, `ContentEditable` is used to create custom selections. However, in certain scenarios where specific styling or behavior is needed, manual adjustments are required. For instance, adding zero-width characters before and after inline-block elements to place the cursor correctly.

In the provided HTML example, different approaches are demonstrated to ensure proper cursor placement within custom selections. Options such as utilizing zero-width characters or `<br>` tags serve the purpose of adjusting the cursor behavior within the designated elements.

In cases where content input is essential without the constraints of `ContentEditable`, custom selection implementations become advantageous. By using native selection APIs and developing a controller layer, precise control over the editor can be achieved.

Nevertheless, facilitating content input poses a challenge as traditional text input methods are not applicable without `ContentEditable`. To override this limitation, hidden `<input>` elements can be employed to enable text input, similar to how tools like CodeMirror address this issue.

The need for hidden `<input>` elements raises concerns such as the inability to select text when the focus is on the input field. This issue necessitates custom selection solutions to maintain text selection functionality while enabling text input through hidden `<input>` fields.

Popular text editing applications like DingTalk Docs and Youdao Cloud Notes utilize custom selection techniques, similar to the open-source Monaco Editor and TextBus, each with its unique approach to handling cursor and selection operations.

Noteworthy is the approach taken by TextBus, which manages cursor rendering on a separate `textarea` element while handling text selection independently. This unique implementation incorporates specialized handling for IME input, event triggering, character deletion, and transient character processing, highlighting the complexity of custom selection implementations, especially concerning input modules.
```

In the end, it was discovered that `TextBus` neither uses the common implementation approach of `ContentEditable`, nor does it draw selections like `CodeMirror` or `Monaco`. From the `DOM` nodes of the `Playground`, it was found that an invisible `iframe` was maintained to achieve this, containing a `textarea` inside to handle `IME` input.

This implementation is quite unique because when inputting content, the text selection disappears, meaning their focus competes with each other. Let's first look at a simple example, using the focus competition between the `iframe` and text selection as an illustration. It can be observed that in a scenario where the `iframe` constantly contends for focus, we are unable to drag the text selection. It's worth mentioning that we cannot directly call `focus` in the `onblur` event, as this action will be blocked by the browser, and must be triggered asynchronously in a macro task.

```html
<span>123123</span>
<iframe id="$1"></iframe>
<script>
  const win = $1.contentWindow;
  win.addEventListener("blur", () => {
    console.log("blur");
    setTimeout(() => $1.focus(), 0);
  });
  win.addEventListener("focus", () => console.log("focus"));
  win.focus();
</script>
```

In fact, this issue is a pitfall I have encountered before. Please note that our focus call directly uses `$1.focus`. If at this point we were to call `win.focus`, then we would observe that the text selection can be dragged. From this behavior, we can see that the document selections in the master and slave frames are completely independent; if the focus is within the same frame, they will compete for focus, whereas if they are in different frames, they will work normally. This illustrates the distinction between `$1` and `win`.

One can notice that the text selection is gray at this point, and this can be styled using the `::selection` pseudo-element. Furthermore, all kinds of events can be triggered normally, such as the `SelectionChange` event and manual selection settings. Of course, placing a `textarea` directly within the `iframe` would yield the same behavior, allowing for normal content input without interrupting `IME` input methods, a magical performance that works well in various browsers.

```html
<span>123123</span>
<iframe id="$1"></iframe>
<script>
  const win = $1.contentWindow;
  const textarea = document.createElement("textarea");
  $1.contentDocument.body.appendChild(textarea);
  textarea.focus();
  textarea.addEventListener("blur", () => {
    setTimeout(() => textarea.focus(), 0);
  });
  win.addEventListener("blur", () => console.log("blur"));
  win.addEventListener("focus", () => console.log("focus"));
  win.focus();
</script>
```

Apart from the unique implementation of `TextBus`, `CodeMirror`, `Monaco/VSCode`, DingTalk Documents, and Youdao Cloud Note editors all feature custom-drawn selections. Drawing custom selections requires consideration of two aspects: calculating the current cursor position and rendering the virtual selection layer. We have previously discussed this in our `diff` and virtual layer implementation; the common approach involves a relatively simple three-line drawing implementation. The solitary row drawing in wrapped scenarios has been observed only in the search and replace feature in Feishu Document.

Hence, the complexity lies in calculating the position of the cursor. Our editor's selection can still adhere to the browser's model for implementation; primarily obtaining the positions of `anchor` and `focus` is sufficient. In browsers, there exist `APIs` to realize cursor position selections using `Range`, which currently only `VSCode` utilizes, while `CodeMirror` and DingTalk Documents have independently implemented cursor position calculation. `CodeMirror` uses binary search to continually compare cursor and character positions, with line breaks in search adding a significant level of complexity.

Speaking of which, the package management in `VSCode` is quite interesting. `VSC` is an open-source application that extracts the core `monaco-editor-core` package. This package is then included as a `dev` dependency in `monaco-editor`, which is bundled into `monaco-editor` during packaging. `monaco-editor` is a repackage of the `core` to enable the editor to run within a browser `web` container, thus realizing the web version of `VSCode`.

Here we can utilize the browser-related `API` to calculate the position of the cursor selection. The compatibility of related `API` when used together is relatively good, but if used in `shadow DOM`, the compatibility is comparatively poor. This is based on the browser's `DOM` implementation. If we were to draw the selection area using `Canvas`, we would need to calculate based entirely on the text being drawn. This part of the implementation is not overly complex. The complexity of `DOM` rendering arises from the difficulty in obtaining text positions and sizes, while in `Canvas`, this information is typically recorded.

```html
<div id="$container" style="width: 200px; word-break: break-word; user-select: none; position: relative;"><div id="$text" data-text>123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123</div><div id="$layer"></div></div>

<script>
  const render = (startRect, endRect) => {
    const block = document.createElement("div");
    block.style.position = "absolute";
    block.style.width = "100%";
    block.style.height = "0";
    block.style.top = startRect.top + "px";
    block.style.pointerEvents = "none";
    const head = document.createElement("div");

    const tail = document.createElement("div");
    $layer.innerHTML = "";
    $layer.appendChild(block);
    block.appendChild(head);
    block.appendChild(body);
    block.appendChild(tail);
    if (startRect.top === endRect.top) {
      // Single line (non-line break) scenario `head`
      head.style.marginLeft = startRect.left + "px";
      head.style.height = startRect.height + "px";
      head.style.width = endRect.right - startRect.left + "px";
      head.style.backgroundColor = "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)";
    } else if (endRect.top - startRect.bottom < startRect.height) {
      // Two lines (fold once) scenario `head + tail` `body` placeholder
      head.style.marginLeft = startRect.left + "px";
      head.style.height = startRect.height + "px";

## Summary
Here we have summarized the relevant **APIs** for browsers. We have implemented basic selection operations based on the `Range` object and `Selection` object, and provided specific application scenarios and examples. Additionally, we discussed the issues encountered with selection in the `Blocks` editor, and finally, we researched various editor implementations with custom selection drawing, providing a simple custom selection drawing example.

Next, we will start from the data model and design the representation of the editor's selection model. Then, building upon the browser's selection-related **APIs**, we will synchronize the editor's selection model with the browser's selection. By using the selection model as the target scope for editor operations, we will achieve fundamental editor functions such as insertion, deletion, formatting, and various boundary operations related to selections.
