# Expressing the State Structure of Editor Selection Model
Previously, we summarized the interaction strategies of the browser selection model, implemented basic selection operations, and researched the implementation of custom selection. Consequently, we also need to design the representation of selections in the editor, also known as model selections. The scope of operations when applying changes in the editor is achieved based on the model selections. Here we will base the design of the model selections on the editor's state to express the structure.

## Editor Selection Model
The design of the selection model in the editor involves a wide range of topics since it serves as the fundamental scope for application changes or executing commands, involving extensive module interactions. Although fundamentally requiring other modules to adapt to the selection model representation, if the selection model is not clear enough, the adaptation work of other modules will become complex. Interaction naturally requires cooperation to achieve.

The selection model most directly depends on the editor's state model, and the design of the state model heavily relies on the design of data structures. Therefore, here we will start from the perspective of data structures and state models to investigate the current mainstream editor's selection model designs.

### Quill
`Quill` is a modern rich text editor, with good compatibility and powerful extensibility, it also provides some out-of-the-box features. The emergence of `Quill` brought many new things to rich text editors, and it is currently a widely popular editor among open-source editors. Its ecosystem is very rich, and it has now released version `2.0`.

The data structure representation of `Quill` is based on `Delta` implementation, meaning data changes can also be based on `Delta`. Representing basic rich text data structure using `Delta` as shown below, we can observe that there are no nested data structures; all content and format representations are linear.

```js
{
  ops: [
    { insert: "This is" },
    { insert: " a piece of text", attributes: { italic: true } },
    { insert: " with" },
    { insert: " data structure", attributes: { bold: true } },
    { insert: " as shown below.\n" },
  ],
};
```

Since the data structure is represented flatly, the representation of selections does not require complex structures to implement. Intuitively, with a flat structure, there will be fewer special cases to handle, the state structure will be easier to maintain, and the editor architecture will be more lightweight. Usually, editors also construct `Range` objects, so the selection structure in `Quill` is as follows:

```js
{
  index: 5, // Cursor position
  length: 10, // Selection length
}
```

As the scope of application changes for editor modifications, it inevitably needs to address applying changes. When applying changes, traversing the state structure is naturally required to extract the nodes that need modification to actually apply changes. Therefore, naturally, the order of the flat structure itself is the rendering order, and there is no need for nested structures for recursive searches, which naturally leads to higher search efficiency.

In addition, `Quill` has redesigned a model `parchment` for the view layer, maintaining the view and state models. Although some class structures have been rewritten through inheritance in the repository, such as the `ScrollBlot` class, it is difficult to determine many design intentions of the view modules while reading the source code, so there is currently no clear understanding of the interaction between DOM events and state models.

### Slate
`Slate` is a highly flexible, fully customizable rich text editor framework that provides a core model and API for developers to deeply customize the editor's behavior. It is more like an engine for rich text editors rather than out-of-the-box components. `Slate` has undergone a major version refactor, and although it is currently in a beta state, many online services are already using it.

The data structure representation of `Slate` is not a flat content representation. Based on its TypeScript type definitions, the `Node` type is a tuple of three types: `Editor | Element | Text`. Leaving out the discussion on `Editor` itself, we can easily see the definitions of `Element` and `Text` types from the descriptions below.

```js
{
  type: "paragraph",
  children: [
    { text: "This is" },
    { text: " a piece of text", italic: true },
    { text: " with" },
    { text: " data structure", bold: true },
    { text: " as shown below." },
  ]
}
```

The `children` attribute can be considered as nodes of type `Element`, while the `text` attribute is nodes of type `Text`. Nodes of type `Element` can infinitely nest `Element` type nodes as well as `Text` type nodes. In this case, a flat selection expression cannot accommodate such a structure, so `Slate`'s selection expression is implemented using endpoints.

```js
{
  anchor: { path: [0, 1], offset: 2 }, // Start position
  focus: { path: [0, 3], offset: 4 }, // End position
}
```

This selection expression should look familiar, `Slate`'s selection expression aligns entirely with browser selections, as its original design principle aligns with the `DOM`. On a side note, `Slate`'s representation of data structures also aligns entirely with selections. For example, when representing an image, an empty `Text` must be inserted as a zero-width character.

```js
{
  type: "image",
  url: "https://example.com/image.png",
  children: [{ text: "" }]
}
```

```html
<div data-slate-node="element" data-slate-void="true">
  <div data-slate-spacer="true">
    <span data-slate-zero-width="z" data-slate-length="0">\u200B</span>
  </div>
  <div contenteditable="false">
    <img src="https://example.com/image.png">
  </div>
</div>
```

In addition to `Void` nodes like images, for inline `Void` nodes, the representation better demonstrates that the internally maintained data structure is entirely aligned with the `DOM`. For instance, in the following `Mention` structure, two zero-width characters are introduced on both sides in the `DOM` to accommodate the cursor position, resulting in the internal data structure maintaining two `Text` nodes.

```js
[
  { text: "" },
  {
    type: "mention",
    user: "Mace",
    children: [{ text: "" }],
  },
  { text: "" },
];
```

```html
<p data-slate-node="element">
  <span data-slate-node="text">
    <span data-slate-zero-width="z" data-slate-length="0">\u200B</span>
  </span>
  <span contenteditable="false">
    <span data-slate-spacer="true">
      <span data-slate-zero-width="z" data-slate-length="0">\u200B</span>
    </span>
    @Mace
  </span>
  <span data-slate-node="text">
    <span data-slate-zero-width="z" data-slate-length="0">\u200B</span>
  </span>
</p>
```

Returning to the topic of the selection model, when `Slate` applies data changes, it also relies on two endpoints for traversing and searching, especially during operations such as `setNode`. Consequently, searching heavily depends on the rendering order. Since the document structure is two-dimensional, finding the start/end nodes by comparing `path + offset` and recursively traversing from the first node to the last node suffices.

Nested data structures complicate batch changes overall, as maintaining the index relationships between `Op` depends on the implementation of `transform`. However, for individual `Op` changes, clarity remains high, resembling the targeted handling of individual operation changes in a `Delta`, while the single change under a `JSON` structure is very clear.

The `transform` part is also a core implementation aspect. Previously, low-code scenarios for state management based on `OT-JSON` and `Immer` were discussed. Typically, a single `Op` change does not affect the `Path`, whereas batch `Op` changes need to consider the mutual relationships between them. For instance, in `Slate`'s `remove-nodes` implementation, the influence relationships are maintained through `ref`.

```js
// packages/slate/src/transforms-node/remove-nodes.ts
const depths = Editor.nodes(editor, { at, match, mode, voids })
const pathRefs = Array.from(depths, ([, p]) => Editor.pathRef(editor, p))

for (const pathRef of pathRefs) {
  const path = pathRef.unref()!
```

```js
if (path) {
  const [node] = Editor.node(editor, path)
  editor.apply({ type: 'remove_node', path, node })
}
```

When it comes to the implementation approach of `Slate` that requires multiple synchronous `apply`, it is not suitable for immediately synchronizing editor changes, as the rendering cost is very high. Therefore, it is more appropriate to wait for all synchronization instructions to be completed and then apply changes to the view layer in batch, which is commonly known as synchronizing data changes and asynchronously rendering views.

```js
// https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate/blob/06b882/packages/slate/src/core/apply.ts#L44
if (!FLUSHING.get(editor)) {
  FLUSHING.set(editor, true)

  Promise.resolve().then(() => {
    FLUSHING.set(editor, false)
    editor.onChange({ operation: op })
    editor.operations = []
  })
}
```

### Lexical
`Lexical` is a modern open-source rich text editor framework developed by `Meta`, focusing on providing ultimate performance, accessibility, and reliability. As the successor to `Draft.js`, it offers better scalability and flexibility. Especially, `Lexical` also provides native support for `iOS`, featuring an extensible text editor built on `Swift/TextKit` with shared design principles and API with `Lexical`.

The data structure of `Lexical` is similar to `Slate`, based on a tree-like nested structure to represent content. However, its overall design includes many preset contents and lacks the flexibility of `Slate` as a versatile editor engine. This can be observed from the data structure representation below, which is already simplified and lacks attributes such as `detail`.

```js
[
  {
    children: [
      { format: 0, mode: "normal", text: "This", type: "text" },
      { format: 2, mode: "normal", text: "is a piece of text", type: "text" },
      { format: 0, mode: "normal", text: "for", type: "text" },
      { format: 1, mode: "normal", text: "data structure", type: "text" },
      { format: 0, mode: "normal", text: "representation.", type: "text" },
    ],
    direction: "ltr",
    indent: 0,
    type: "paragraph",
    version: 1,
    textFormat: 0,
  },
]
```

Since it is a nested data structure, the selection representation in `Lexical` is similar to the implementation in `Slate`. However, the selection in `Lexical` is more similar to `ProseMirror` implementation, dividing the selection into types such as `RangeSelection`, `NodeSelection`, `TableSelection`, and `null` selection type.

The `Table` and `null` selection types are unique and will not be discussed for now. Regarding `Range` and `Node`, they can actually be represented in the same way. `Node` is used for `Void` types like images or dividers, while `Quill` and `Slate` integrate them directly into `Range` representation using zero-width text characters as selection points.

Special representations naturally have special meanings. While `Quill` and `Slate` use zero-width characters to homogenize text selection representation, `Lexical` does not have placeholder zero-width characters, making direct homogenization of text selection representation impossible. For `Lexical`, the basic text `RangeSelection` selection is as follows:

```js
{
  anchor: { key: "51", offset: 2, type: "text" },
  focus: { key: "51", offset: 3, type: "text" }
}
```

Here, although the data structure is similar to `Slate`, the `path` part has been replaced with `key`. It's important to note that in the data structure shown earlier, there was no identification like `key`. This `key` value is a temporary state value and not maintained within the data structure. Although it may look like a number, it is actually expressed as a unique `id` in the form of a string.

```js
// packages/lexical/src/LexicalUtils.ts
let keyCounter = 1;

export function generateRandomKey(): string {
  return '' + keyCounter++;
}
```

In fact, this kind of `id` generation method exists in many places, including `Slate` and our `BlockKit`, and it just happens that we both use this method to generate `key` values. Since our view layer is rendered through `React`, it inevitably needs to maintain unique `key` values, and in `Lexical`, the `key` value also maintains the role of state mapping.

So essentially, the `key` value here maintains the relationship between `id` and `path`, and we should be able to directly obtain the rendering node state through the `key` value. By using this method, it is actually equivalent to leveraging temporary `path` to achieve comparison of any `key` strings, and being able to prune towards the tail node along the corresponding `nextSibling`, which reminds me of maintaining a partial order relationship.

```js
// packages/lexical/src/LexicalSelection.ts
const cachedNodes = this._cachedNodes;
if (cachedNodes !== null) {
  return cachedNodes;
}
const range = $getCaretRangeInDirection(
  $caretRangeFromSelection(this),
  'next',
);
const nodes = $getNodesFromCaretRangeCompat(range);
return nodes;
```

Here, what is important is the state preservation when the `key` value changes, because the content of the editor actually needs to be edited. However, achieving immutability, it is clear that mapping the `key` based on the reference of the state object would cause the entire editor `DOM` to be rebuilt. For example, adjusting the heading level could lead to a complete reconstruction of the line due to the change in the line's `key`.

So, reusing `key` values as much as possible becomes a matter to be studied. The `key` at the line level of our editor is specially maintained, achieving immutability and reusing `key` values. The leaf node's `key` depends on the `index` value, so by studying the implementation of `Lexical`, we can also apply it to the maintenance of our `key` values.

Through debugging in the `playground`, it can be observed that even if we cannot know if it is an implementation of immutability, it is evident that the `key` in `Lexical` is maintained in a somewhat left-biased manner. Therefore, in our editor implementation, we can also leverage the same method to directly reuse based on the left value, and when splitting, if starting from `0`, reuse directly, otherwise create a new `key`.

1. Given the text `[123456(key1)][789(bold-key2)]`, removing the bold from `789` while keeping the `key` value of the entire text as `key1`.
2. Given the text `[123456789(key1)]]`, bolding the text `789`, keeping the `key` value of the left side `123456` text as `key1`, and assigning a new `key` to `789`.
3. Given the text `[123456789(key1)]]`, bolding the text `123`, keeping the `key` value of the left side `123` text as `key1`, and assigning a new `key` to `456789`.
4. Given the text `[123456789(key1)]]`, bolding the text `456`, keeping the `key` value of the left side `123` text as `key1`, and assigning new keys to `456` and `789`.

Speaking of which, `Lexical` is not entirely based on `React` as the view layer; it merely supports the mounting of `React` component nodes. The main `DOM` nodes, such as bolding and heading formatting, are still implemented in the view layer, and it's easy to determine whether they are rendered using `React` by checking if properties like `__reactFiber$` exist in the console.

```js
// Slate
__reactFiber$lercf2nvv2a: {}
__reactProps$lercf2nvv2a: {}

// Lexical
__lexicalDir: "ltr"
__lexicalDirTextContent: "These are the data structures of such a text."
__lexicalKey_siggg: "47"
__lexicalTextContent: "These are the data structures of such a text.\n\n"
```

### Feishu Document
Feishu Document is a rich text editor developed based on the concept of `Blocks`. As one of the core applications of Feishu, it provides powerful document editing features. Feishu Document deeply integrates components such as documents, tables, and mind maps, supports real-time collaboration among multiple users in the cloud, integrates deeply with the Feishu suite, and is highly adapted for mobile devices, making it an excellent commercial product.

Feishu Document is a commercial product and not an open-source editor, so the data structure can only be explored through the interface. By directly examining the `SSR` data structure of Feishu, you can find the basic content as shown below, simply outputting `DATA` on the console. Of course, since the text data is based on the `EasySync` collaborative algorithm of `EtherPad`, this part has also been discussed in articles on the `Delta` data structure.

```js
{
  doxcnTYlsMboJlTMcxwXerq6wqc: {
    id: "doxcnTYlsMboJlTMcxwXerq6wqc",
    data: {
      children: ["doxcnXFzVSkuH3XoiT3mqXvOx4b"],
    },
  },
  doxcnXFzVSkuH3XoiT3mqXvOx4b: {
    id: "doxcnXFzVSkuH3XoiT3mqXvOx4b",
    data: {
      type: "text",
      parent_id: "doxcnTYlsMboJlTMcxwXerq6wqc",
      text: {
        apool: {
          nextNum: 3,
          numToAttrib: { "1": ["italic", "true"], "2": ["bold", "true"] },
        },
        initialAttributedTexts: {
          attribs: { "0": "*0+2*0*1+4*0+1*0*2+4*0+5" },
          text: { "0": "This is an example of a text structure." },
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

Of course, this data structure seems quite complex. We can directly get an overview of the entire data structure from the response example in the server-side `API` of Feishu Open Platform. This part of the data structure seems to have undergone a data transformation, not a direct response. In fact, this structure can be considered similar to `Slate`'s tree structure, but each line is an independent instance.

Although Feishu documents appear to have a flat structure, the actual state values constructed are still tree-like structures. The `id` is used to achieve a chain-like structure, enabling the construction of the entire tree structure. Therefore, for the selection structure of Feishu documents, it is naturally necessary to adapt to the data structure state model. For text selections in Feishu documents, the structure is as follows:

```js
// PageMain.editor.selectionAPI.getSelection()
[
  { id: 2, type: "text", selection: { start: 3, end: 16 } },
  { id: 6, type: "text", selection: { start: 0, end: 2 } },
  { id: 7, type: "text", selection: { start: 0, end: 1 } },
];
```

Since Feishu documents are designed with `Blocks` block structure, maintaining selections for pure text is naturally not enough. Therefore, in block-level selection expression, Feishu's selection expression is as follows. Speaking of which, if Feishu documents perform block-level selection across levels, when the mouse is lifted, deeper-level block selections will be merged into selections at the same level.

```js
// PageMain.editor.selectionAPI.getSelection()
[
  { id: 2, type: "block" },
  { id: 6, type: "block" },
  { id: 7, type: "block" },
];
```

For deep-level `Blocks`-level text selections, similar to `Editor.js`, it does not support selecting text across nodes; Feishu documents support selecting text across lines, but in the case of selecting text across levels, it will be promoted to block-level selections at the same level; `Slate/Lexical` and other editors support selecting text across levels. Of course, they are not editors designed based on the `Blocks` concept, mainly supporting nested nodes.

Editors designed based on the `Blocks` concept are actually more like low-code design, equivalent to implementing a restricted low-code engine, more precisely, a no-code engine. The restriction here mainly refers to not being as flexible as a graphic drawing board with drag-and-drop operations, but rather an editor form based on certain rules, such as block components needing to occupy a single line, and structures not being able to nest arbitrarily.

In this nested data structure, there are naturally many feasible ways to express selections. Feishu documents' method of promoting selections at the same level should be more suitable because in this case, handling related data will be simpler, and it does not entirely disallow selecting text across nodes, nor does it require recursive searching to retrieve related nodes, striking a balance between data representation and performance.

## Selection Structure Design
After researching the selection model designs of current mainstream editors, we need to design our editor's selection model based on similar principles. First, design selection objects for the data structure, which are typically `Range` objects present in editors, and then express the state model, considering this as the basis for designing the editor's state selection structure.

### RawRange
In the browser, the `Range` object is the basic representation of selections. However, for editors, they usually implement their own `Range` objects. In such cases, when implementing `IOC DI`, we can independently allocate a separate name for the browser's `Range` object.

```js
import DOMNode = globalThis.Node;
import DOMText = globalThis.Text;
import DOMElement = globalThis.Element;
```

So, as mentioned earlier, our editor's data structure design is based on the implementation transformation of `Delta`. Therefore, the design of the `Range` object can also be consistent with the selection design of the `Quill` editor since the selection design directly depends on the data structure design. To distinguish our upcoming design solution, we name it `RawRange`.

```js
export class RawRange {
  constructor(
    /** Start point */
    public start: number,
    /** Length */
    public len: number
  ) {}
}
```

Since the `RawRange` object actually represents a linear range, it only needs two `number`s to express itself. However, in order to better express its semantics and related calling methods, such as `isBefore` and `isAfter`, we also have its internal representation of the `Point` object.

```js
export class RawPoint {
  constructor(
    /** Starting offset */
    public offset: number
  ) {}

  /**
   * Determine if Point1 is before Point2
   * - i.e., < (p1 p2), otherwise >= (p2 p1)
   */
  public static isBefore(point1: RawPoint | null, point2: RawPoint | null): boolean {
    if (!point1 || !point2) return false;
    return point1.offset < point2.offset;
  }
}
```

Based on this, methods like `intersects` and `includes` can be implemented, which are quite important for various operations on selections. For example, the `intersects` method can be used to determine the selection state of block-level nodes, because `void` nodes themselves are non-textual content, and browsers do not have a selection state for them.

```js
export class RawRange {
 public static intersects(range1: Range | null, range2: Range | null) {
    if (!range1 || !range2) return false;
    const { start: start1, end: end1 } = range1;
    const { start: start2, end: end2 } = range2;
    // --start1--end1--start2--end2--
    // => --end1--start2--
    // --start1--start2--end1--end2--  ✅
    // => --start2--end1--
    const start = Point.isBefore(start1, start2) ? start2 : start1;
    const end = Point.isBefore(end1, end2) ? end1 : end2;
    return !Point.isAfter(start, end);
  }
}
```

```js
export class SelectionHOC extends React.PureComponent<Props, State> {
  public onSelectionChange(range: Range | null) {
    const leaf = this.props.leaf;
    const leafRange = leaf.toRange();
    const nextState = range ? Range.intersects(leafRange, range) : false;
    if (this.state.selected !== nextState) {
      this.setState({ selected: nextState });
    }
  }
```

```js
public render() {
  const selected = this.state.selected;
  return (
    <div
      className={cs(this.props.className, selected && "block-kit-embed-selected")}
      data-selection
    >
      {React.Children.map(this.props.children, child => {
        if (React.isValidElement(child)) {
          const { props } = child;
          return React.cloneElement(child, { ...props, selected: selected });
        } 
        return child;
      })}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Range
Since we have the design of `RawRange` selection object, a corresponding design for the `Range` object is naturally there. Here, the design of our `Range` object is directly based on the implementation of the editor state. Therefore, one can consider that our `RawRange` object is based on the data structure, while the `Range` object is based on the editor state model.

Let's first look at the declaration of the `Range` object, the implementation here is relatively more refined expression. In the `Point` object, we maintain the line index and the inline offset, and in the `Range` object, we maintain the starting point and the ending point of the selection. At this point, the interval in the `Range` object always points from `start` to `end`, and the `isBackward` is used to indicate whether the selection is in a backward state.

```js
export class Point {
  constructor(
    /** Line index */
    public line: number,
    /** Inline offset */
    public offset: number
  ) {}
}

export class Range {
  /** Starting point of selection */
  public readonly start: Point;
  /** Ending point of selection */
  public readonly end: Point;
  /** Selection direction */
  public isBackward: boolean;
  /** Selection collapse state */
  public isCollapsed: boolean;
}
```

It is very important that the selection interval always points from `start` to `end` in the `Range` object. This will be very useful in our subsequent synchronization of browser selection and editor selection states. Because the `anchor` and `focus` obtained by the browser's `Selection` object are not always pointing from `start` to `end`, we need to obtain relevant nodes from the `Selection` in order to maintain our `Range` object.

From the existing data structure, the `Delta` data structure does not contain any line-related data information, so we need to obtain line index and inline offset from the status maintained by the editor. Maintaining independent status changes itself is a complex matter, which we will need to look into later on. For now, let's take a look at the data maintained by various rendering node states.

```js
export class LeafState {
  /** Line index to which the Op belongs */
  public index: number;
  /** Starting offset of the Op */
  public offset: number;
  /** Op length */
  public readonly length: number;
}

export class LineState {
  /** Number of Leaf nodes in the Line */
  public size: number;
  /** Starting offset of the Line */
  public start: number;
  /** Line index number */
  public index: number;
  /** Overall text width of the Line */
  public length: number;
  /** Leaf nodes */
  protected leaves: LeafState[] = [];
}
```

Therefore, the `Selection` object implemented in the browser is based on `DOM`, so synchronizing the editor's selection model through `DOM` nodes also needs to be dealt with. However, here, we first build the `Range` object based on obtaining the selection from the status model. Since in the above implementation, we are based on the point `Point`, naturally we can separate points to process intervals.

```js
const leafNode = getLeafNode(node);
let lineIndex = 0;
let leafOffset = 0;

const lineNode = getLineNode(leafNode);
const lineModel = editor.model.getLineState(lineNode);
// When there is no LineModel, the selection will be placed at the front of the BlockState
if (lineModel) {
  lineIndex = lineModel.index;
}
```

```js
const leafModel = editor.model.getLeafState(leafNode);
// If there is no LeafModel, the selection will be placed at the beginning of the Line
if (leafModel) {
  leafOffset = leafModel.offset + offset;
}
return new Point(lineIndex, leafOffset);
```

In this way, we have separated the states of `LineState` and `LeafState`, and we can directly retrieve the line index and inline offset of the `Point` object from the relevant states. Please note that here we are obtaining the inline offset rather than the leaf node's offset. Similar to how `Slate` calculates the offset based on `Text` nodes, this is also a design choice for the selection model.

In other words, our current selection implementation is the `L-O` implementation, which stands for Line and Offset index level implementation. This means that the `Offset` here may span across multiple actual `LeafState` nodes. Therefore, this `Offset` will require additional iterations when implementing selection searches, providing a flexible implementation.

```js
const lineNode = editor.model.getLineNode(lineState);
const selector = `[${LEAF_STRING}], [${ZERO_SPACE_KEY}]`;
const leaves = Array.from(lineNode.querySelectorAll(selector));
let start = 0;
for (let i = 0; i < leaves.length; i++) {
  const leaf = leaves[i];
  let len = leaf.textContent.length;
  const end = start + len;
  if (offset <= end) {
    return { node: leaf, offset: Math.max(offset - start, 0) };
  }
}
return { node: null, offset: 0 };
```

I have also considered implementing the `L-I-O` selection model, which is similar to `Slate`'s data structure but simplified into 3 levels instead of allowing unlimited nesting like `Slate`. The advantage of this approach is that the selection model is clearer since there is no need to loop through lines to find the selection. However, the downside is the increased complexity of the selection and the `L-O` model represents a flexible and complex compromise implementation.

```js
export class Point {
  constructor(
    /** Line index */
    public line: number,
    /** Node index */
    public index: number,
    /** Node offset */
    public offset: number
  ) {}
}
```

Lastly, we also need to implement methods for converting between `RawRange` and `Range` objects. Even within the editor, these conversions are frequently needed, for operations like line breaks, line deletions, etc., using `Range` objects for convenience, and `RawRange` objects when transforming selections based on `Delta`.

Converting from `RawRange` to `Range` objects is akin to transforming a linear range into a two-dimensional range, thus necessitating a search of the line states for selections. Given that our `LineState` object indices increase linearly, the most common approach for ordered sequence search is binary search.

```js
export class Point {
  public static fromRaw(editor: Editor, rawPoint: RawPoint): Point | null {
    const block = editor.state.block;
    const lines = block.getLines();
    const line = binarySearch(lines, rawPoint.offset);
    if (!line) return null;
    return new Point(line.index, rawPoint.offset - line.start);
  }
}

export class Range {
  public static fromRaw(editor: Editor, raw: RawRange): Range | null {
    const start = Point.fromRaw(editor, new RawPoint(raw.start));
    if (!start) return null;
    const end = !raw.len ? start.clone() : Point.fromRaw(editor, new RawPoint(raw.start + raw.len));
    if (!end) return null;
    return new Range(start, end, false, raw.len === 0);
  }
}
```

The conversion from a `Range` object to a `RawRange` object is relatively simple, as we only need to convert the row index and the row offset to a linear offset. Since the offset information for rows is recorded on the row object at this point, we can directly retrieve the relevant values and add them together.

```js
export class RawPoint {
  public static fromPoint(editor: Editor, point: Point | null): RawPoint | null {
    if (!point) return null;
    const block = editor.state.block;
    const line = block.getLine(point.line);
    if (!line || point.offset > line.length) {
      editor.logger.warning("Line Offset Error", point.line);
      return null;
    }
    return new RawPoint(line.start + point.offset);
  }
}

export class RawRange {
  public static fromRange(editor: Editor, range: Range | null): RawRange | null {
    if (!range) return null;
    const start = RawPoint.fromPoint(editor, range.start);
    const end = range.isCollapsed ? start : RawPoint.fromPoint(editor, range.end);
    if (start && end) {
      // Ensure that start points to end
      return new RawRange(start.offset, Math.max(end.offset - start.offset, 0));
    }
    return null;
  }
}
```

## Summary
Previously, we implemented basic selection operations based on `Range` objects and `Selection` objects, illustrating specific application scenarios and examples. In contrast, here we summarize the investigation of modern rich text editor selection model designs, and based on the data model, we designed two selection models, `RawRange` and `Range` objects.

Next, we need to synchronize the editor selection model with the browser selection based on the representation of the editor's selection model. By using the selection model as the target range for editor operations, we can implement basic editor operations such as insertion, deletion, formatting, and many selection-related boundary operations.
