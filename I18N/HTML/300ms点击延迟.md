# 300ms Click Delay
The `300ms` click delay on mobile devices is due to the ability to perform double-tap zoom operations. Therefore, after a `click` event, the browser waits for `300ms` to see if the user performs another click, in order to determine whether the action is a single tap or a double tap. If we replace the `click` event with the `touchstart` event, it can cause some problems. The `touchstart` event is triggered as soon as the user touches the screen, sometimes even when the user intends to scroll the screen. Additionally, if there are two overlapping elements, `A` and `B`, and the `touchstart` event of element `A` is bound to a callback function that hides element `A` itself, then when element `A` is clicked and disappears, the event sequence is `touchstart -> touchend -> click`. If there is no second click within `300ms`, the `click` event will be triggered. However, since element `A` has disappeared, the `click` event will be triggered on element `B`. If element `B` is a link or has a `click` event bound to it, the default behavior of element `B` or the bound event callback will be unexpectedly triggered. This is known as the click-through problem. To solve this problem, we still need to address the `300ms` delay of the `click` event.

## Solutions

### Disable Zooming
By completely disabling zooming, the double-tap zoom functionality will be disabled, and the browser will remove the `300ms` click delay. However, in this case, the pinch-to-zoom functionality will also be disabled.

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="user-scalable=no">
<!-- or -->
<meta name="viewport" content="initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1">
```

### Change the Default Viewport Width
If the browser encounters a page that includes `width=device-width`, which means the viewport width is equal to the device width or set to a value smaller than the `viewport` value, the double-tap zoom behavior will be disabled, and therefore, the `300ms` click delay will also be eliminated. This solution does not completely disable zooming, but only disables the browser's default double-tap zoom behavior. Users can still zoom the page using the pinch-to-zoom gesture.

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">
```

### touch-action
The `touch-action` property in CSS is used to define how touch-screen users can manipulate the area of an element. It allows the removal of the touch delay for specific elements or the entire document without disabling zooming.

```css
touch-action: none;
/* Browser compatibility: https://caniuse.com/#search=touch-action */
```

### FastClick
`FastClick` is a lightweight library developed by FT Labs specifically to solve the `300ms` click delay problem on mobile browsers.

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    FastClick.attach(document.body);
}, false);
