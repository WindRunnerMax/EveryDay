# Common Compatibility Issues
Browsers have a large number of different versions, and the rendering engines of different types of browsers are also different. Therefore, different browsers may have differences in parsing code, which leads to inconsistent rendering effects on web pages.

## Initializing Styles
Due to browser compatibility issues, different browsers have different default style values for tags. If styles are not initialized, it will cause display differences between different browsers and layout problems. Therefore, it is necessary to initialize styles to achieve consistent layout.  
The most direct solution is to use `*` to initialize styles, but it will load styles and calculate style priorities for all tags, which may have an impact on performance.

```css
* { 
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
}
```
Usually, `Normalize.css` is used to normalize the default style differences. Of course, you can also customize your own `reset.css` based on the styles.

```html
<link href="https://cdn.bootcss.com/normalize/7.0.0/normalize.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
```

## Kernel Style Compatibility
Before the `CSS3` standard was finalized, some browsers had already implemented some features based on the initial drafts. In order to be compatible with the later finalized standards, each browser used its own vendor prefix to distinguish from the standard. After the standard was established, major browsers gradually supported `CSS3` new properties without prefixes. Many vendor prefixes can now be omitted. However, in order to be compatible with older versions of browsers, it is still recommended to use vendor prefixes and standard methods for a smooth transition.

|Kernel| Representative Browser | Prefix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Trident | IE Browser | -ms |
| Gecko | Firefox | -moz |
| Presto | Opera | -o |
| Webkit | Chrome, Safari | -webkit |

## Transparency Property
The `opacity` property used to set the transparency of an element is a property in `CSS3` and is supported by modern browsers. For older versions of browsers, it can be supported by adding vendor prefixes. For `IE6-IE8`, it can be supported by the `filter` property. For `IE4-IE9`, compatibility support can be provided through filter syntax.

```css
opacity: 0.5;
-moz-opacity:0.5;
filter: alpha(opacity = 50); //IE6-IE8
filter: progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Alpha(style = 0, opacity = 50); //IE4-IE9
```

## Media Queries
For browsers that do not support `CSS3` media queries below `IE9`, `respond.js` is usually used as a compatibility solution.

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.bootcss.com/respond.js/1.4.2/respond.min.js"></script>
```

## HTML5 Tags
For browsers that do not support new `HTML5` tags below `IE9`, you can create elements using `document.createElement` and set their `CSS` styles. Usually, `html5shiv.js` is used as a compatibility solution.

```html
<script>
    document.createElement('header');
</script>
<style>
    header{display: block;}
</style>
```

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.bootcss.com/html5shiv/3.7.3/html5shiv.min.js"></script>
```

## Compatibility of placeholder
`placeholder` is a new attribute added in `html5`. When `input` or `textarea` is set with this attribute, the value will be displayed as a gray hint in the text box. The hint text will disappear when the text box gains focus or when content is entered. To ensure compatibility, first check if `input` supports `placeholder`. If it doesn't, you can achieve the `placeholder` effect by using the `onfocus` and `onblur` event listeners of `input`.

```html
<!-- Simple example -->
<input type="text" value="Tips" onFocus="this.value = '';" onBlur="if (this.value == '') {this.value = 'Tips';}">
```

## Event listener handler
Before `IE9`, `attachEvent` was used instead of the standard method `addEventListener` to register element listeners. To handle event compatibility issues, it is usually necessary to encapsulate an adapter method to filter event handler binding and removal.

```javascript
var handler = {}

// Bind event
handler.on = function(target, type, handler) {
    if(target.addEventListener) {
        target.addEventListener(type, handler, false);
    } else {
        target.attachEvent("on" + type,
            function(event) {
                return handler.call(target, event);
            }, false);
    }
};

// Remove event listener
handler.remove = function(target, type, handler) {
    if(target.removeEventListener) {
        target.removeEventListener(type, handler);
    } else {
        target.detachEvent("on" + type,
        function(event) {
            return handler.call(target, event);
        }, true);
    }
};
```

## Prevent default behavior
The recommended way to prevent default behavior by `W3C` is to use `event.preventDefault()`. This method only prevents the default behavior without stopping the event propagation. For browsers before `IE9`, preventing default behavior requires using `window.event.returnValue = false`. Returning `false` directly in the event handler function can also prevent default behavior, but it is only effective in `DOM0` level model. In addition, using `return false` in `jQuery` will both prevent default behavior and event propagation. It is also common to encapsulate a method to achieve the prevention of default behavior.

```javascript
handler.preventDefault = function(event) {
    event = event || window.event;
    if (event.preventDefault) {
        event.preventDefault();
    } else {
        event.returnValue = false;
    }
}
```

## Stop event propagation
The recommended way to stop event propagation by `W3C` is to use `event.stopPropagation()`. For browsers before `IE9`, it is done by using `window.event.cancelBubble = true;`. It is also common to encapsulate a method to achieve the prevention of event propagation.

```javascript
handler.stopPropagation = function(event) {
    event = event || window.event;
    if (event.stopPropagation) {
        event.stopPropagation();
    } else {
        event.cancelBubble = false;
    }
}
```

## Scroll Height
To get the scroll height of the window `scrollTop`, a compatibility writing style is needed, even if the `<DOCTYPE>` declaration is made, different browsers may handle the document differently.

```javascript
var scrollTop = document.documentElement.scrollTop || document.body.scrollTop;
```

## Date and Time
Use the `new Date()` constructor to generate a date and time object. The syntax `new Date("2020-06-29")` may output `invalid date` in some earlier browsers. This is mainly because early browsers do not support the `-` in expressing dates, and `/` is widely supported. Therefore, when dealing with compatibility in earlier browsers, `-` needs to be replaced with `/`.

```javascript
new Date("2020-06-29".replace(/-/g, "/"));
```

## IE Conditional Comments
A syntax specifically provided by IE, which can only be recognized and executed by IE, while other browsers treat it as a comment.

```html
<!--[if lt IE 9]>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.bootcss.com/respond.js/1.4.2/respond.min.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.bootcss.com/html5shiv/3.7.3/html5shiv.min.js"></script>
<![endif]-->
```

```html
<!--[if !IE]>  Recognizable by all browsers except IE   <![endif]-->
<!--[if IE]>   Recognizable by all versions of IE   <![endif]-->
<!--[if IE 6]>   Recognizable by only IE6   <![endif]-->
<!--[if lt IE 6]>   Recognizable by IE6 and versions below IE6   <![endif]-->
<!--[if gte IE 6]>   Recognizable by IE6 and versions above IE6   <![endif]-->
<!--[if IE 7]>   Recognizable by only IE7   <![endif]-->
<!--[if lt IE 7]>   Recognizable by IE7 and versions below IE7   <![endif]-->
<!--[if gte IE 7]>   Recognizable by IE7 and versions above IE7   <![endif]-->
<!--[if IE 8]>   Recognizable by only IE8   <![endif]-->
<!--[if IE 9]>   Recognizable by only IE9   <![endif]-->
```

```html
<!-- 
    ! NOT operator
    lt Less than operator
    lte Less than or equal to operator
    gt Greater than operator
    gte Greater than or equal to operator
    & AND operator
    | OR operator
    () Subexpression operator used to create more complex expressions with boolean operators
-->
