## Hi ~

If you like it, please give a `star` on this [EveryDay](https://github.com/WindrunnerMax/EveryDay) üòÅ

This is a learning journey of a frontend newbie,If you only learn without recording anything, it's basically equivalent to learning in vain. The name of this repository `EveryDay` hopes to inspire me to learn every day. The `gh-pages` branch of the repository is my blog site, the content in the blog is relatively extensive, including study notes of the daily question, records of working on projects, and problems encountered, etc. For technical related articles are written mainly based on summarizing and learning from various articles, the content includes`HTML` basics, `CSS` basics, `JavaScript` basics and extension, `Browser` related, `Vue` usage and analysis, `React` usage and analysis, `Plugin` related, `RichText` related, `Patterns` design patterns, `Linux` commands, `MiniProgram` related, `App` related, `PHP` related, `Java` related, `Security` related, `Environment` setup, `IMGProcess` image processing, `LeetCode` solutions, `Interview` related, `MyLife` related, etc. The content is relatively basic and is written with the goal of being able to run immediately. 

You can [Timeline](https://github.com/WindrunnerMax/EveryDay/blob/master/CATALOG.md) if you want to read the articles in the order I wrote them. If you want a neat view, visit [Blog](https://blog.touchczy.top/). The blog is also the `gh-pages` branch of this repository, which was built on `Git Pages` as a static page and uses `jsdelivr` and `cloudflare` for cache to alleviate access speed problems in China. Later, an `SSG` version of the [Blog-SSG](https://blog-ssg.touchczy.top/) was deployed on the `gh-pages-ssg` branch, and provided an English translation version with the help of `ChatGPT`. The branch is deployed on `Vercel` to alleviate access speed problems in China. There is more content in my blog, besides study notes there are project work records and problems encountered, etc. if you like it, please give a `star`. This is really important to me.
