# Principles of WeChat Mini Program Implementation

WeChat mini programs are developed using `wxml`, `wxss`, and `javascript`. Essentially, it is a single-page application where all page rendering and event handling take place within a single page. However, it can also call various native interfaces through the WeChat client. WeChat's architecture follows the data-driven MVVM pattern, where the view UI and data are separated, and all page updates are achieved through data changes. 

The mini program is divided into two parts: `Webview` and `AppService`. `Webview` is mainly used for rendering interfaces, while `AppService` is used for handling business logic, data, and interface calls. Communication is achieved through the system-level `JSBridge`, enabling the rendering of UI and event handling.

## Architectural Design
The WeChat mini program framework consists of two parts: the `View` layer and the `AppService` logic layer. The `View` layer is responsible for rendering page structures, while the `AppService` layer handles logic processing, data requests, and interface calls. They run in two separate processes within two `Webview` instances.

The view layer and logic layer communicate through the system-level `JSBridge`. The logic layer notifies the view layer of data changes, triggering page updates, while the view layer notifies the logic layer of triggered events for business processing.

``` 
WeChat loads all views into a `Webview`, referred to as the `View` layer. All the `JS` code for logic processing is loaded into another `WebView`, referred to as the `AppService` layer. Each mini-program has only one and remains in memory throughout its entire lifecycle. The `JSBridge` encapsulates message communication and access to system capabilities through the `App`, enabling message communication by calling the corresponding methods on different platforms. The development environment uses `window.postMessage` on `iOS`, `WKWebview` uses `window.webkit.messageHandlers.invokeHandler.postMessage`, and `WeixinJSCore.invokeHandler` is used on `Android`. In terms of the `Js` engine, the `X5` kernel is used on `Android`, while `JavaScriptCore` is used on `iOS`, and the `nwjs Chrome` kernel is used in the development tool. 

By using the `View` presentation layer and the `AppService` logic layer, a dual-threaded solution for running mini-programs is achieved. With two threads, code can be placed in a sandbox for secure and controlled execution. Of course, dual-threading is only one solution for a mini-program. If multiple mini-programs are to be run on one `App`, a multi-threaded approach should be adopted, not only for performance considerations, but also to prevent mutual interference between mini-programs.

## Underlying Support
The WeChat mini-program development tool has some compilation support templates and underlying support files for mini-programs.
* `transWxmlToJs`: `wxml` to `js`
* `transWxssToCss`: `wxss` to `css`

* `transWxmlToHtml`: `wxml` to `html`
* `transManager`: Manager
* `WAConsole.js`: Framework `JS` library, console capabilities
* `WAWebview.js`: Framework `JS` library, providing basic `API` capabilities for the view layer, primarily encapsulating message communication as `JSBridge` messages, packaging the log component `Reporter`, rendering view aspects under the `wx` object `Api`, mini-program component implementation and registration, `VirtualDOM` and `diff` and `Render UI` implementation, page event triggering processing
* `WAService.js`: Framework `JS` library, providing basic `API` capabilities for the logic layer, primarily encapsulating message communication as `JSBridge` messages, packaging the log component `Reporter`, most `Api` methods under the `wx` object, `App()` mini-program entry, `Page()` page entry, `getApp` and other global methods, data binding, event dispatch, lifecycle management, routing management, modularization capabilities, etc.
