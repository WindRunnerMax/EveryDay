# Browser Local Storage Solutions
Browser local storage solutions can be divided into three aspects, namely `Cookie`, `Web Storage`, and `IndexedDB`.

## Cookie
Because the `HTTP` protocol is stateless, once the data exchange is completed, the connection will be closed, and reconnecting is required for further data exchange, which means that the server cannot track the session from the connection. If both `A` and `B` purchase an item at the same time, without session tracking, the server cannot determine who actually bought the item. To enable session tracking, the server issues a pass to each client, and each visit requires carrying the pass, allowing the server to distinguish the user's identity.  
`Cookie` is actually a small piece of text information that the server sends to the browser as a pass, and the browser stores the pass and automatically carries the pass information for each request from the same source (CSRF cross-site request forgery is based on this strategy), allowing the server to determine the user's identity.  
`Cookie` is usually used to store some general data, such as user's login status, preferences, and not recommended for storing business data. Although with the advancement of technology, the storage mechanism provided by `HTML5` has gradually replaced `Cookie`, some older browsers are still incompatible with the `Web` storage mechanism. Therefore, in some cases, `Cookie` may still be needed to store some business information to handle compatibility requirements.

### Advantages
* `Cookie` has very good compatibility and is compatible with all mainstream browsers on the market.

### Disadvantages
* Small storage capacity, although the storage capacity varies in different browsers, it is basically around `4KB`.
* Performance impact, because `Cookie` will be sent by the browser as a request header, so when there is excessive information stored in `Cookie`, it will affect the efficiency of resource acquisition for a specific domain and increase the workload of document transmission.
* Security issues, any data stored in `Cookie` can be accessed, so sensitive information should not be stored in `Cookie`. In addition, important `Cookie` also needs to use `HTTP ONLY` to prevent malicious `JS` read and write.
* Due to the abuse of third-party `Cookie`, some users may disable `Cookie` while browsing the web, so we have to test whether the user supports `Cookie`.

  },
  setItem: function (sKey, sValue, vEnd, sPath, sDomain, bSecure) {

    var sExpires = "";
    if (vEnd) {
      switch (vEnd.constructor) {

          sExpires = vEnd === Infinity ? "; expires=Fri, 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT" : "; max-age=" + vEnd;

          break;
        case Date:
          sExpires = "; expires=" + vEnd.toUTCString();
          break;
      }
    }
    document.cookie = encodeURIComponent(sKey) + "=" + encodeURIComponent(sValue) + sExpires + (sDomain ? "; domain=" + sDomain : "") + (sPath ? "; path=" + sPath : "") + (bSecure ? "; secure" : "");
    return true;
  },
  removeItem: function (sKey, sPath, sDomain) {
    if (!sKey || !this.hasItem(sKey)) { return false; }
    document.cookie = encodeURIComponent(sKey) + "=; expires=Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT" + ( sDomain ? "; domain=" + sDomain : "") + ( sPath ? "; path=" + sPath : "");
    return true;
  },
  hasItem: function (sKey) {
    return (new RegExp("(?:^|;\\s*)" + encodeURIComponent(sKey).replace(/[-.+*]/g, "\\$&") + "\\s*\\=")).test(document.cookie);
  },
  keys: /* optional method: you can safely remove it! */ function () {
    var aKeys = document.cookie.replace(/((?:^|\s*;)[^\=]+)(?=;|$)|^\s*|\s*(?:\=[^;]*)?(?:\1|$)/g, "").split(/\s*(?:\=[^;]*)?;\s*/);
    for (var nIdx = 0; nIdx < aKeys.length; nIdx++) { aKeys[nIdx] = decodeURIComponent(aKeys[nIdx]); }
    return aKeys;
  }
};
```

## Web Storage
The `Web` storage mechanism was initially defined as part of `HTML5` in the form of an API, but it was later separated and became an independent standard due to its uniqueness and various other reasons. The `Web` storage standard API includes the `localStorage` object and the `sessionStorage` object. Its emergence is mainly due to the need for a way to store session data outside of cookies, as well as a mechanism to store a large amount of data that can exist across sessions. In fact, the original `Web` storage specification included the definition of two objects: `sessionStorage` and `globalStorage`, both of which exist in browsers that support these objects in the form of properties of the `Window` object.

### localStorage
The `localStorage` object, as a solution for persistently storing client-side data, replaced the previously mentioned `globalStorage` in the revised `HTML5` specification. Compared to cookies, `localStorage` provides a simple and clear API for operation, is more secure, and can store a larger amount of data. For these reasons, `localStorage` is considered as an alternative to cookies, but caution should still be taken not to store sensitive information in `localStorage`.  
The data stored through `localStorage` is permanent, unless we use `removeItem` to delete it or the user deletes it by configuring the browser. The data will remain on the user's computer indefinitely. The scope of `localStorage` is limited to the document origin level, meaning that only documents from the same origin can share it. Documents from the same origin can share `localStorage` data, read each other's data, and implement communication between same-origin windows through the `onstorage` event, although the scope of `localStorage` is also subject to browser restrictions.

### sessionStorage
`sessionStorage` is another major object of the `Web` storage mechanism. The `sessionStorage` property allows us to access a `session Storage` object, which is similar to `localStorage` but differs in that the data stored in `localStorage` does not have an expiration time set, while `Session Storage` only stores data for the current session page, and the data is only cleared when the user closes the current session page or browser. Additionally, pages derived from a session can also access the previously set data, even if the newly derived page is not from the same origin as the source page.

### Usage

```javascript
// Store data
localStorage.setItem("key", "value");
sessionStorage.setItem("key", "value");
/**
 * Since storing data calls the toString() method,
 * object types will be stored as the string [object Object]
 * so when storing, use JSON.stringify() to convert to a string
 * when retrieving, use JSON.parse() to convert the string back to an object
 */

// Read data
localStorage.getItem("key");
sessionStorage.getItem("key");

// Delete data
localStorage.removeItem("key");
sessionStorage.removeItem("key");

// Clear data
localStorage.clear();
sessionStorage.clear();
```

## IndexedDB
Although the `Web` storage mechanism is very convenient for storing small amounts of data, it is not quite suitable for developers' needs in storing larger amounts of structured data. `IndexedDB` was created to address this need. It is a local storage provided by `HTML5` for storing large data structures in a web browser and provides indexing capabilities for high-performance searching. It is generally used to save a large amount of user data and for scenarios that require searching between data. When the network is disconnected, users can perform some offline operations.

### Usage
An example of using `IndexedDB` to facilitate communication between multiple same-origin tabs.

```javascript
// Page A
var db = null;
var request = indexedDB.open("message");
request.onsuccess = (e) => db = e.target.result;
request.onupgradeneeded = function(event) {
    db = event.target.result;
    if (!db.objectStoreNames.contains('message')) {
        db.createObjectStore('message', { keyPath: 'key' });
    }
};

function setData(data){
    var transaction = db.transaction(['message'], 'readwrite');
    var store = transaction.objectStore(['message']);
    var requestData = store.put({ key: "msg", info: data});
    requestData.onsuccess = function(e) { 
        console.log(e.target.result);
    };
};

setTimeout(() => setData(1),1000);

```

```javascript
// Page B
var db = null;
var request = indexedDB.open("message");
request.onsuccess = (e) => db = e.target.result;
function readMsg(){
    var transaction = db.transaction(['message']);
    var objectStore = transaction.objectStore('message');
    var requestResult = objectStore.get('msg');

    requestResult.onsuccess = function(event) {
        console.log(requestResult.result.info);
   };
}

setTimeout(readMsg, 3000);

```
