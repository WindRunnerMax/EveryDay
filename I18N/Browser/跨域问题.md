# Cross-Domain

When establishing `HTML` rules, for security reasons, a website from one origin is not allowed to interact with resources from another origin, and the browser sets this rule as the **same-origin policy**.

The same origin refers to websites having the same domain, that is, the **protocol, host, and port** are the same.

Embedding cross-origin resources is allowed, but the browser restricts `JavaScript` from interacting with the loaded content, such as embedded `<script>`, `<img>`, `<link>`, `<iframe>`, among others.


## Restricted Scenarios
* `XHR` requests cannot be sent.
* Modification of cross-origin request resources is impossible.
* `Cookie` and `LocalStorage` from different origins cannot be accessed.

## Cross-Domain Solutions
### JSONP for Cross-Domain Data Requests
Since `<script>` can request cross-origin resources, a `callback` function name can be appended dynamically to a `<script>` tag using the `DOM`, which will be called upon completion of the request.
```javascript
// Frontend
function jsonpHandle(data){console.log(data);} // Function definition. The function will be called with parameters upon completion of the request.
var url = "http://127.0.0.1/test.php?callback=jsonpHandle";
var obj = $('<script><\/script>');
obj.attr("src",url);
$("body").append(obj); // Dynamically add a script
```
```php
// Backend Implementation
$data = ["a" => 1, "b" => 2];
$callback = $_GET['callback'];
return $callback."(".json_encode($data).")";
```
### CORS for Cross-Domain Requests
For simple requests, the browser will directly send a `CORS` request by adding the `Origin` request header in the header. Likewise, in the response header, the server will return the relevant `CORS` header fields it has set, with the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` field allowing the source to make cross-origin requests. When sending the request, the browser will specify the requesting source in the `Origin` request header, and if the server allows cross-origin requests from that source, it will return successfully.
For non-simple requests, the browser will first automatically send an `OPTIONS` request. If the server supports the request, it will send the actual request to the backend. Otherwise, if the server does not support the request, an error will be logged in the console.

```php
// Response Headers
header('Content-Type: text/html;charset=utf-8');
header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin:http://localhost:8080'); // Use * to allow requests from any origin
header('Access-Control-Allow-Methods:POST,GET'); // Allowed request types
header('Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true'); // Indicates whether the response can include credentials
header('Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type,Origin,Refer'); // Allow custom request headers
```
### Nginx Proxy
By using proxy, listening on the same port, and adding different paths, cross-origin access between different services can be achieved.

```
location  /test
{
    proxy_pass   http://127.0.0.1:81;
}
```

### Image Ping
Simply create a new `<img>` and include some basic data in the address. This method only supports `get` requests and can only send requests to the server unilaterally, which is commonly used for tracking ad impressions and is also frequently employed in `XSS` attacks to obtain `cookies`.

```html
<img src="http://127.0.0.1?key=value">
```

### Same primary domain `document.domain`
For example, for `www.example.com` and `abc.example.com`, their primary domain is the same.

```javascript
document.domain = "example.com"; // Same primary domain
var ifrWin = document.getElementById("ifr").contentWindow; // Can manipulate iframe
```

### Sharing data with `window.name`
Different domain iframes store shared information in `window.name`, this method only applies to cross-origin communication between two iframes.

```javascript
window.name = JSON.stringify({"a":1,"b":2})
```

### `window.postMessage`
Use `window.postMessage` to send messages to other `window` objects, regardless of whether the `window` object belongs to the same origin or a different origin. This method cannot be used to exchange data with the server.

```javascript
// Main window
window.frames[0].postMessage({"a":1},"http://127.0.0.1:81")
// Iframe // For security reasons, verify the source
window.addEventListener('message',(event)=>{
  if(event.origin === "http://127.0.0.1") console.log(event.data);
});
```
