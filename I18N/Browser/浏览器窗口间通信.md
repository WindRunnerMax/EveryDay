# Browser Window Communication

Browser communication between multiple tabs or windows mainly refers to the communication among multiple pages from the same origin. The main methods include local storage communication, `Web Worker` communication, and `Web Socket` communication.

## Local Storage Communication
Communication is achieved through the shared strategy of local storage for same-origin pages. The main methods include `localStorage`, `cookie`, and `indexedDB`. It is important to note that `sessionStroage` is effective within the same session. According to `MDN`, it is mentioned that when clicking a link or opening a new tab using `window.open`, they belong to the same session. The new tab will inherit the `sessionStroage` of the parent session. However, opening a new tab always initializes a new session, even if they are of the same origin, they do not belong to the same session.

### localStorage

```javascript
// Page A
localStorage.setItem('msg', Math.random());
```

```javascript
// Page B
window.addEventListener("storage", function (e) {
  console.log(e);
})
// The onstorage event
// It will only be triggered when localStorage is modified by a non-current page. Modifying localStorage from the current page will not trigger the listening function.
// The listening function will only be triggered when modifying the original data value. It will not be triggered if the new value is the same as the original value.
```

### cookie
```javascript
// Page A
document.cookie = "msg=1;path=/";
```

```javascript
// Page B
function getCookie(key){
    var cookies = {};
    document.cookie.replace(/\s*/g,"").split(";").forEach((v) => {
        let unit = v.split("=");
        cookies[unit[0]] = unit[1];
    })
    return cookies[key];
}
setInterval(() => {
    console.log(getCookie("msg"));
}, 1000);
```

### IndexedDB
```javascript
// Page A
var db = null;
var request = indexedDB.open("message");
request.onsuccess = (e) => db = e.target.result;
request.onupgradeneeded = function(event) {
    db = event.target.result;
    if (!db.objectStoreNames.contains('message')) {
        db.createObjectStore('message', { keyPath: 'key' });
    }
};

function setData(data){
    var transaction = db.transaction(['message'], 'readwrite');
    var store = transaction.objectStore(['message']);
    var requestData = store.put({ key: "msg", info: data});
    requestData.onsuccess = function(e) { 
        console.log(e.target.result);
    };
};

setTimeout(() => setData(1),1000);
```


```javascript
// Page B
var db = null;
var request = indexedDB.open("message");
request.onsuccess = (e) => db = e.target.result;
function readMsg(){
    var transaction = db.transaction(['message']);
    var objectStore = transaction.objectStore('message');
    var requestResult = objectStore.get('msg');

    requestResult.onsuccess = function(event) {
        console.log(requestResult.result.info);
   };
}

setTimeout(readMsg, 3000);
```

## Web Worker
In `HTML5`, `Web Worker` can be divided into two different types of threads, one is a dedicated worker, and the other is a shared worker.  
A dedicated worker can be created directly using `new Worker()`, and it is exclusive to the current page.  
A `SharedWorker` can be shared by multiple windows, tabs, and iframes, but they must ensure that these pages are from the same origin.  
```javascript
// Page A
var worker = new SharedWorker('worker.js');
worker.port.start();
worker.port.postMessage(1);
```

```javascript
// Page B
var worker = new SharedWorker('worker.js');
worker.port.start();
worker.port.onmessage = function(event){
    console.log(event.data);
};
```

```javascript
// worker.js
var portArr = [];
onconnect = function(e) {
  var port = e.ports[0];
  if(portArr.indexOf(port) === -1) portArr.push(port);
  port.onmessage = function(e) {
    portArr.forEach( v => {
        v.postMessage(e.data);
    })
  }
}
```

## Web Socket
Using `Web Socket` to transfer data through the server can achieve communication between browser windows, but it consumes considerable server resources. `WebSocket` is a full-duplex communication protocol over a single `TCP` connection provided from `HTML5`. It simplifies data exchange between clients and servers, allowing the server to push data to the client actively. In the `WebSocket API`, the browser and the server only need to perform a handshake once, and then a persistent connection is established, enabling bidirectional data transfer. During the handshake phase, the `HTTP` protocol is used, and additional header information is included in the normal `HTTP` message, with the `Upgrade: WebSocket` header indicating a protocol upgrade request.
* It is built on top of the `TCP` protocol and belongs to the application layer like `HTTP`.
* It can send both text and binary data.
* Its data format is lightweight, with minimal performance overhead and high communication efficiency.
* There is no same-origin policy, and the client can communicate with any server.
* The protocol identifier is `ws`, and if encrypted transmission is used, it is `wss`.
