# CSS Pseudo-classes and Pseudo-elements

The concept of pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements in CSS is introduced to format information outside the document tree. In other words, pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements are used to style parts of the document that are not represented in the document tree, such as the first letter of a sentence or the first element in a list.

## Pseudo-classes
Pseudo-classes are used to add corresponding styles to elements when they are in a certain state, which changes dynamically based on user behavior. For example, when a user hovers over a specified element, we can describe the state of this element using `:hover`. Although it is similar to regular CSS classes and can be used to add styles to existing elements, it can only add styles to elements in states that cannot be described by the DOM tree, hence the name "pseudo-class".

### State-based Pseudo-classes
These are selected based on the current state of an element. The state of an element changes dynamically during user interaction, so the element will present different styles based on its state. When an element is in a certain state, it will have a certain style, and when it enters another state, that style will be lost.

* `:link` applies to links that have not been visited.
* `:hover` applies to elements when the mouse hovers over them.
* `:active` applies to elements that are being activated.
* `:visited` applies to links that have been visited, mutually exclusive with `:link`.
* `:focus` applies to elements that have keyboard input focus.

### Structural Pseudo-classes
These are new selectors introduced in CSS3 that use the DOM tree to filter elements. They match elements based on the interrelationships of the document structure, reducing the need for defining `class` and `id` attributes and making the document structure more concise.

* `div:first-child` selects every `div` element that is the first child of its parent.
* `div:last-child` selects every `div` element that is the last child of its parent.
* `div:nth-child(n)` selects every `div` element that is the nth child of its parent.
* `div:nth-last-child(n)` same as above, but counting starts from the last child of this element.
* `div:nth-of-type(n)` selects every `div` element that is the nth `div` element of its parent.
* `div:nth-last-of-type(n)` same as above, but counting starts from the last child.
* `div:first-of-type` selects every `div` element that is the first `div` element of its parent.
* `div:last-of-type` selects every `div` element that is the last `div` element of its parent.
* `div:only-child` selects every `div` element that is the only child of its parent.
* `div:only-of-type` selects every `div` element that is the only `div` element of its parent.
* `:empty` selects elements that have no content.
* `:checked` matches `input` elements that are checked, including `radio` and `checkbox`.
* `:default` matches elements that are the default selection, for example, submit buttons are always the default buttons in forms.
* `:disabled` matches disabled form elements.
* `:enabled` matches form elements that do not have the `disabled` attribute set.
* `:valid` matches form elements that pass the validation criteria.

## Pseudo-elements
Pseudo-elements are used to create elements that are not in the document tree and apply styles to them. In fact, pseudo-elements are used to perform tasks that regular selectors cannot do, such as adding text before an element and styling that text using `::before`.

The CSS3 specification requires using a single colon `:` for CSS3 pseudo-classes and a double colon `::` for CSS3 pseudo-elements, in order to distinguish between pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements.

* `::first-letter` selects the first letter of the text in an element.
* `::first-line` selects the first line of the text in an element.
* `::before` inserts new content at the beginning of the element's content.
* `::after` inserts new content at the end of the element's content.
* `::selection` matches the portion of the content that the user has selected or is in a highlighted state.
* `::placeholder` matches the placeholder text, and this pseudo-element only takes effect when the element has the `placeholder` attribute set.
