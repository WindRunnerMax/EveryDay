# Tencent Autumn Recruitment Official Batch Front-end Interview

The resume was submitted around `8:00 PM on September 15, 2022`. There shouldn't be too many open positions at Tencent this time, and there's only one chance for the front-end written test. It seems like they scheduled the interview before the scheduled time. It's been a long time since I last interviewed with Tencent. It's quite exciting. Thanks to Tencent for the interview opportunity.

## First Round
After the October 1st holiday, I kind of slacked off and my mindset changed a bit. Then suddenly Tencent called to invite me for an interview. It's really exciting as it's been a long time since I last interviewed. This time, the interview was mainly scenario-based questions, and I was a bit caught off guard. I received a call around `2:40 AM on October 11, 2022` to schedule the interview for `11:15 AM on October 12, 2022`, and the interview lasted about `35 minutes`.

* Common cross-origin request methods and principles.
* Write a wrapper method for the `withJSONP` request.
* The difference between basic data types and reference data types, with two specific scenarios.
* `this` in JavaScript and how to change its reference.
* The difference between strong caching and conditional caching, and whether there will be a re-request when the conditional caching is missed.
* If an image resource is cached for a year, how should you handle the modification of this resource.
* The difference between `git merge` and `git rebase`.
* The difference between the `a` tag in `VueRouter`'s `Link` component and a self-written `a` tag.
* When `Promise`'s `reject` returns a value, which parameter receives it in the subsequent `then` method.
* Methods to obtain all `div` elements on a page and the differences between `HTMLCollection` and `NodeList` collections.
* Sorting a collection of student objects based on their grades and ages.
* Returning an array of an arithmetic sequence given the first value, last value, and number of terms.
* Further, if given an `rgb` color, how would you implement a gradient color.
* When `padding-left` or `padding-top` is a percentage, which element is it calculated based on.
* Implementing search results in an input box by using a given string as a condition for filtering.
* How does a CDN determine the nearest server for the resources.

There were really a lot of scenario-based questions in this interview. It required quick thinking and coming up with feasible solutions. Some questions left me stumped, but I quite like this interview format. After all, it's been a long time since I last used my skills in this way. During the follow-up questions, I inquired about the department, and it turns out to be the "WeTest" department, which I had interned in before at Tencent. Overall, the interview went well.

## Aftermath
Today I checked, and the process has ended, which was more or less expected. This year, Tencent's total headcount for all positions is in the three digits, so it's definitely not a casual program.
