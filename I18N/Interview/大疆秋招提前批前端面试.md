# DJI Early Admission Front-end Interview

I almost had no interviews during the autumn admissions, so I am very grateful to any company that gave me the opportunity to interview. It's been tough. I submitted my resume on the afternoon of `2022.07.30`, directly through the official website, without any referral code. Then the written test was on `2022.08.07 19:00`.

## First Round

After almost a month of waiting, I finally got an interview opportunity. I scheduled the interview for around `2022.08.24 16:30` and the interview took place on `2022.08.27 17:30`. The interview was scheduled for ten hours in the meeting room, so it seems that multiple interviews were conducted simultaneously. The interview was conducted by three experts, with two of them being the main interviewers, and the interview lasted for `44 minutes`.

After the technical questions, I asked the two interviewers about the business they are involved in and areas I need to improve. It's the same old story. The business areas include e-commerce, official website, and low-code platform, and DJI does have a wide range of businesses. As for my personal improvement, it is essential to expand my technical expertise based on business requirements, such as technology selection and similar aspects. Both of these interviewers turned on their cameras and the interview was conducted in a conversational and pleasant manner, providing a very good interview experience.

## Second Round

The second interview was scheduled for around `2022.08.29 15:40`, and the interview time was set for `2022.09.01 17:45`. The interview time was quite extreme. This time, there were still four experts, but only one of them talked to me, and the interview lasted only `28 minutes`. It seems that I didn't pass, as even the second interviewer wasn't interested in talking to me.

* Which `Github` projects are currently being maintained?
* What are the challenges encountered while working on these projects?
* Recent problems encountered and their solutions.
* There are many similar products in the market, so why create a resume editor from scratch?
* The difficulties encountered while developing this resume editor.
* The recent challenges faced at Byte and how the work was divided.
* Primary responsibilities at Byte.
* How to address a situation where a colleague mishandles the work previously assigned to you.
* Research on unit testing strategies at Tencent.
* The rationale behind conducting unit testing and how you promoted this initiative.
* The percentage of completed unit testing.
* Any areas for improvement in your previous work?
* What books have you been reading recently?
* Why choose to read the book on `JavaScript` frameworks?
* What did you learn from this book?
* Why choose to read about `jQuery` instead of exploring new frameworks?
* Do you have knowledge of new front-end technologies?
* The problems solved by the `TailwindCSS` framework.
* How to apply this framework.

This time, the conversation didn't follow a rigid format. We discussed various topics, as in a previous interview, I was asked about my opinions on new front-end technologies. In turn, I asked for the interviewers' thoughts on the future development direction of front-end technologies. Although one of the interviewers shared a lot, my internet suddenly lagged, and I missed out on much of the discussion. I only caught the part about cross-platform development and the future development of `Node`, unfortunately, that's when the connection dropped.

## HR Interview

Since previous interviews involved `HR` representatives, there wasn't a separate `HR` interview. Essentially, the recent phone call was more of a courtesy call, which came around `2022.10.09 16:00`, where the `HR` wanted to know about my current `offer` situation and added me on WeChat. After that, I continued to wait for the next update.

## Follow-up

Around `2022.09.28 12:00`, I received an email, stating that I had entered the comprehensive evaluation phase, indicating that I successfully passed all the interviews and entered the final selection phase. Subsequently, I had the aforementioned `HR` interview and added the interviewer on WeChat. Unfortunately, around `2022.10.11 15:30`, I was informed that although I passed all interview stages for the position, my name was not on the `offer` list due to the limited recruitment quota. They asked if I was willing to consider a position on the client-side. I agreed to the transfer, but sadly, around `2022.11.01 19:30`, I received a thank-you note from DJI. This time, it's a definitive end. I hope to have another opportunity to join DJI in the future.
