# Shunfeng autumn recruitment formal batch front-end interview

The resume was submitted around 16:00 on August 20, 2022, and the written test was scheduled for August 31, 2022, at 16:00. I'm grateful to Shunfeng for giving me the opportunity to interview.

## First round
Today I had three interviews, man, I don't know what's going on today, crazy interviews all over the place. But Shunfeng's interview process was like an assembly line, it was basically a routine interview. They notified me of the interview time at around 10:44 on September 7, 2022, and the interview was on September 8, 2022, at 14:30, lasting about 22 minutes.

- How is browser caching implemented?
- What are the methods for judging variable types in JavaScript?

This interview felt a bit rushed, and it was purely routine. During the feedback stage, the interviewer asked me about related business matters, and after the introduction, he mentioned that recruitment for campus positions would be organized centrally. It seems that the department after the campus recruitment might be the one from the interview. Overall, it was quite good.

## Second round
The second round was scheduled around 01:59 on September 12, 2022. They directly sent an email with a fixed time and scheduled the interview for September 14, 2022, at 15:30. The first round was a routine, while the second round just said, "show me code." They immediately looked at my GitHub code. It was quite exciting; I didn't even need to introduce myself. This interview lasted about 28 minutes.

- Do you have any project demos?
- Why did you choose to apply to Shunfeng?
- How do you rate your technical skills?
- Have you reflected on why you have sent out so many resumes without success?

- What is 'rollup' used for and understanding of its underlying principles?
- Understanding of TypeScript and why it's needed.

This was my first interview where I didn't even need to introduce myself. The interviewer was quite impressive, immediately asking to see some demos of the projects I've been working on. So I directly showed my GitHub to the interviewer, primarily introducing my document editor and resume editor. It seemed like the interviewer flipped through my GitHub, checking out a lot of commit records. The interviewer was quite interesting during the feedback stage, asking if I would be reassigned after campus recruitment, and also giving some personal advice. The interviewer suggested that I should study design patterns more, as they are essential for front-end development. Additionally, in some project work, I should actively communicate more. Finally, the interviewer mentioned their perspective on algorithms, stating that while focusing on algorithms may not be necessary, design patterns are definitely crucial. Overall, the interview experience was very good, and the interviewer was really fun to chat with.

## HR Interview
The HR interview was scheduled around 18:38 on September 22, 2022. They directly sent an email with a fixed time and scheduled the interview for September 25, 2022, at 11:30. The interviewer was a beautiful lady, and it was my first HR interview this fall. I am extremely grateful for the opportunity given by Shunfeng. The interview lasted about 17 minutes.

The interviewer, the lady, was so beautiful. During the feedback stage, she asked about the approximate time frame for the result and mentioned that the final distribution would be after all the campus recruitment interviews in October. This was my first HR interview this fall, and I really have to say a big thank you to Shunfeng. They truly gave me face and this fall has not been easy for someone without influential background.

## Follow-up
Shunfeng was my second intention this fall. I sent the letter of intent on October 9, 2022, and then received the formal offer on October 25, 2022. This fall's job hunting has really been tough, and it's not easy to have an offer. I am truly grateful to Shunfeng.
