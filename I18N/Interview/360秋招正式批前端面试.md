# 360 Autumn Recruitment Formal Front-end Interview

The resume was submitted at around 11:00 am on `August 1, 2022`, and then the written test was scheduled for `August 27, 2022, 14:00`. Thanks to `360` for giving me the opportunity for an interview.

## First Round
This was the third interview today and I was informed about the interview via email at around `18:24 on September 6, 2022`. I was able to choose the time, so I selected `18:00 on September 8, 2022` for the interview. The interview lasted for about `35 minutes` and there were two interviewers. The interview experience was quite good.

- How many companies are currently interviewing you?
- What kind of work did you mainly do at Tencent?
- How did you implement the live streaming component?
- Please explain the Shan Ke Xia Zhan Mini Program and its specific functions.
- How did you integrate the payment function?
- How did you handle the callback for successful payments?
- What is the biggest difference between `Vue` and `React`?
- Handwrite type checking, handwrite the `reduce` method.
- How did you optimize the first screen at Tencent?
- What technical requirements did you handle during your time at ByteDance?
- What was the biggest challenge during your internship and how did you resolve it?
- How do you deal with problems at work?

Actually, during the interview, we mainly chatted, so it seems like there weren't that many questions. During the Q&A stage, I also asked about related business matters. The work here is also related to the internal infrastructure construction, it is a whole set of R&D process work, from development to online deployment. So, I think the work here fits quite well with my experience. Both interviewers were quite good, and the interview experience was very positive.

## Second Round
The second round was scheduled for `September 13, 2022, 09:25`, and the interview time was fixed directly via email for `September 15, 2022, 14:30`. We had a lot of discussions, but unfortunately, I wasn't quite familiar with some of the topics. This interview lasted about `41 minutes`.

- What functionalities did you implement while developing the rich text editor?
- What problems did you encounter and how did you solve them?
- Compare the data formats of `Slate` and `Quill`.
- What performance optimization and compatibility issues did you consider?
- How did you implement the drag-and-drop feature in the resume editor?
- What optimizations did you implement for drag-and-drop?
- What cases did you handle, and were they put into production?
- How did you optimize the first screen performance during your Tencent internship?
- Introduce the `CI/CD` and the responsibilities at Tencent and ByteDance.
- How would you handle an interruption issue in atomic services?
- How do you match `url` in `nginx` configuration?
- What is your approach to handling `session` synchronization?
- How do you quickly learn a new thing?

This interviewer is obviously quite experienced, and his questions left me feeling a bit bewildered. My small projects indeed seemed a bit unimpressive. Although it seemed like there weren't many questions, since the conversations were quite in-depth, each question took quite a long time. During the Q&A session, I was asked about specific business details, mainly related to the construction of basic R&D processes, and also about my work related to rich text editing. Therefore, many questions about rich text editing were asked. In addition, there was some simple discussion. The interview experience was still very good, just a bit tough, haha.

## HR Interview
The `HR` interview was scheduled for `October 13, 2022, 17:38`, and the interview time was fixed directly via email for `October 14, 2022, 16:20`. This was the `HR` interview after a month's gap, and it was the second `HR` interview of my autumn recruitment. I'm very grateful to `360` for the opportunity. The interview lasted about `21 minutes`.

- Self-introduction.
- Some of the outsourcing projects you've worked on before.
- What are your interests or hobbies?
- The biggest takeaway from your internship.
- Difficulties you encountered during your internship and how you dealt with them.
- Your planned arrangement leading up to graduation.
- Selection of the city for your job location.
- How smoothly is your autumn recruitment going?

This interviewer was really kind and the interview was purely a conversation, without any particularly challenging questions. He even praised me for being quite mature, which made me feel a bit embarrassed, haha. The result might only come after the completion of the campus recruitment process in October, probably early November. This was also my second `HR` interview of this autumn recruitment, and I'm really, really grateful to `360`, haha.

## Follow-up
`360` was my fifth target company for autumn recruitment this year. On `December 07, 2022, 10:26`, they intended to extend an offer, but unfortunately, this was a bit late as I had already accepted another offer by then. I heard that `360` also has a very good work-life balance, so I still think it's worth considering.
