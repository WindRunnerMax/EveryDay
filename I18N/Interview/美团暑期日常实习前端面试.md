# Meituan Summer Daily Internship Front-end Interview

This time I had an interview with the Big Data Analysis Department of the Meituan Basic Research and Development Platform. Well, the name sounds impressive, and I actually applied for the position a long time ago, but I never took the written test, so the process couldn't move forward. I finally did the test last Saturday. I want to give a shout-out to Meituan for giving me the opportunity to have an interview even though I only got an `0 AC`.

## First Interview
The first interview was scheduled on `2021-03-29 17:00` and lasted for `40 minutes`. I didn't expect to get an interview opportunity despite only getting an `0 AC` on the written test, and the interview was scheduled so quickly. They called me in the middle of the day to schedule the interview. The interviewer was clearly very knowledgeable, and I felt a bit embarrassed because of their expertise, but they were also quite interesting.

- Standard self-introduction session.
- How I learned front-end development and my learning direction.
- Inquired about the timing and duration of the internship.
- Types of local storage for `H5` and their differences.
- How to clear `localStorage` and `Cookie`.
- Under what circumstances will `Cookie` not be sent automatically.
- How to resolve cross-domain issues.
- Principle of `JSONP`.
- How `CSS` is scoped to components in `Vue`.
- How to penetrate the `CSS` of components.
- How extensively I use `ES6` and what features I have used.
- Explained the asynchronous flow of `Promise` and how it solves asynchronous issues.
- Implemented `Promise.allSettled`, the interviewer found my implementation quite exaggerated and hadn't seen it done like that before.
- Attempted an algorithm: finding the length of the longest palindrome in a long string, but couldn't solve it.
- `Vue` lifecycle.
- Lifecycle of `keep-alive` component in `Vue`.
- How to implement custom components in `Vue` and how `v-model` works.
- Introduced my mini-program project, its implementation, and the reasons behind it.
- Inquired about maintaining the school's website and how I handle passwords, if I have experience with encryption.
- Asked about data caching, whether it's real-time crawling or periodically refreshing data.
- Revisited the internship duration.
- Asked me to introduce the department.

The first interview was quite basic. The interviewer was quite interesting, but I felt embarrassed about not being able to solve the algorithm question.

## Follow-up
To be precise, there was no follow-up. They didn't contact me for a long time. I feel like it might be because I'm from the 23rd intake, and they might not prefer that. After all, the interviewer asked me several times about being from the 23rd intake. It's okay, I'll just consider it as passing the first interview, haha.
