# JD Autumn Recruitment Official Front-end Interview

I submitted my resume around `10:00`AM on `2022.08.09`, and then I had a written test at `19:00` on `2022.08.27`. I am grateful to JD for giving me the opportunity for an interview.

## First Round
This was the second interview today, and I received an email notification for the interview around `10:40` on `2022.09.06`. I was able to choose the time, and I chose to interview at `17:00` on `2022.09.08`. The interview lasted approximately `35` minutes. The interviewer seemed quite experienced, and the questions asked during the first round were quite challenging.

* What problem does `Promise` solve?
* Why was `Promise` named `Promise`?
* Understanding of low-code development.
* Give a few examples of how low-code development can provide value in a professional setting.
* Understanding of micro frontends.
* The main problems solved by micro frontends and how they are achieved.
* Different approaches for isolating `Js` and `CSS`.
* Understanding of `Docker` and the problems it solves.
* Understanding of `Kubernetes` and its specific purposes.
* Basic principles of `git` and comparison with `svn`.
* Detailed explanation of the encryption process in `HTTPS` transmission.
* Why is `git` branch management efficient, pointers/copying.
* The biggest difference between `Vue` and `React`.
* Differences related to `Svelte`.

The interviewer seemed very experienced, and the questions asked left me a bit puzzled. During the follow-up questions, I inquired about the department's business. This time, the interview was related to JD Cloud, which perfectly aligns with my current internship at ByteDance Cloud. Additionally, there were some virtualization, public cloud, and hybrid cloud-related job responsibilities. Overall, it went quite well.

## Second Round
I scheduled the second interview around `10:24` on `2022.09.09`, and the interview time was set for `14:00` on `2022.09.13`. This time it was a phone interview, and it had been quite a while since I experienced this form of interview. The only other phone interview I had was back in March with Ant Group. Nevertheless, it worked out well as there was no need to worry about a sudden network failure. The interview lasted approximately `35` minutes.

* Why did I choose front-end development?
* Short-term and long-term career planning.
* Study habits and open-source project involvement.
* Brief introduction to low-code development implementation.
* Projects supported.
* Challenges faced in rich-text editors.
* Approaches to collaborative writing by multiple authors.
* Challenges faced in implementing a rich-text editor.
* Main responsibilities during the Tencent internship.
* Brief explanation of the live broadcast feature implementation.

* R&D processes at Tencent.
* Communication and collaboration with product and backend teams.
* Development process at ByteDance.
* Reasons for choosing to apply to JD and views on JD.

The interviewer seemed very knowledgeable. If I could pinpoint the specific details, the interviewer was willing to explain some of his insights, such as the architectural aspects of `taro`, static compilation, dynamic `runtime`, `proxy`, and using business as a common language for communication with colleagues from various fields. The interviewer was quite articulate. During the follow-up questions, I continued to inquire about cloud-related business, and we had an engaging discussion. Although my internship at ByteDance is in the front-end division, we are responsible for front-end, back-end, product, business, testing, and more, so I have honed my soft skills. Overall, it went very well, especially when delving into specific topics, the interviewer was very talkative.

## Follow-Up
On the afternoon of `2022-09-27`, I checked the official website and found out that I had been recommended, which means I did not pass. I was quite confident in myself, and after the second round, I received feedback quite quickly. Everything was going smoothly, and I was expecting to pass, but in the end, I didn't. Well, getting used to being rejected is part of the process.
