# Baidu Autumn Campus Recruitment Front-End Interview

The autumn campus recruitment for the `23rd` batch has officially started. This year's recruitment is almost **nonexistent in terms of hiring**, making it extremely difficult and challenging. The situation is quite tough as there are only `80` headcounts for front-end positions in Baidu's Beijing office, leaving it to fate. I submitted my resume in the evening around `9:00 PM` on `July 14, 2022`, and Hu Ge directly provided a referral to Baidu's internal network drive.

## First Interview
The first interview of the autumn recruitment was quite nerve-wracking. I was so nervous that I almost couldn't speak properly, and my thoughts were a bit unclear. Mainly because I have been busy with my internship and didn't have time to focus on algorithmic problem-solving. With only `80` headcounts available this autumn, it's practically impossible to compete. The interview was scheduled for `16:00` on `July 25, 2021`, with a duration of `45 minutes`.

In the feedback session, I asked the interviewer about the business they are involved in and where I need to improve personally. The business is built around Baidu's network drive and includes various derivative products like mini-programs. Personally, I need to deepen my technical understanding as I have a general understanding but lack depth. The interviewer was quite amicable, but it felt awkward without them turning on the camera.

## Second Interview
The second interview was surprisingly prompt. Shortly after completing the first interview, I received a call to schedule the second interview. It was supposed to be within three days, but the second interview was arranged much quicker. Unfortunately, I couldn't solve the last `easy` problem, and I felt quite embarrassed about my lack of solid foundational knowledge. The first interviewer scheduled the session for `19:00` on `July 27, 2021`, for a duration of `30 minutes`. It seems that the first interviewer had some urgent matters and was replaced by another interviewer, who made me wait for ten minutes.

* Reasons for studying front-end development.
* Approach to learning front-end development on a regular basis.
* How was your previous internship experience?
* What were your academic achievements during your graduate studies?
* Research focus during your graduate studies and any significant accomplishments.
* How were your academic achievements during your undergraduate studies?
* A comparison of features and drawbacks between the rich text editors `Slate` and `Quill`.
* Description of the final version of the rich text editor.
* Brief introduction of recent projects.
* Principles behind mini-program cross-platform functionality.
* Why did you choose to develop mini-programs instead of `H5`?
* Familiarity with `NodeJS` and understanding of backend languages.
* Preorder traversal of a binary tree.

During the feedback session, I inquired about areas for improvement, and the interviewer provided several suggestions, emphasizing the need to strengthen my fundamentals (especially as I struggled with the `easy` question) and deepen my technical knowledge. The interviewer's advice was indeed reasonable, and my confusion over the `easy` question was a bit embarrassing. Interestingly, the second interviewer also chose not to turn on the camera, which seemed to be a tradition within their team.

## Follow-up
On the evening of `July 28, 2021`, I discussed with Hu Ge and learned that they had already sent out the result. To be honest, I had mentally prepared myself for this outcome quite early on, so I didn't feel any strong emotions. Upon analysis, it's clear that the major subjective reason was my poor performance on the `easy` question, which was entirely within my control. However, during the second interview, the interviewer initially made me wait and then switched to a different interviewer, even asking for my resume midway through the interview. I also admit that I failed to showcase my strengths during the interview, but the interviewer also didn't provide me with enough opportunities and time to do so. Overall, there were both subjective and objective factors influencing the outcome. I'll need to continue striving, especially considering how challenging this year is.
