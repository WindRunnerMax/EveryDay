# Differences between HTML and XHTML

`HTML`, which stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, is a descriptive language. `XHTML`, which stands for Extensible HyperText Markup Language, is also a descriptive language, similar to `HTML` in terms of presentation, but with stricter syntax. In terms of relationship, `HTML` is an application based on the Standard Generalized Markup Language (`SGML`), `XML` is a subset of `SGML`, and `XHTML` is based on `XML`.

## Language Basics
* `XHTML` is based on the Extensible Markup Language (`XML`).
* `HTML` is based on the Standard Generalized Markup Language (`SGML`).

## Strictness of Syntax
* `HTML` has looser syntax requirements.
* `XHTML` requires elements to be closed, including empty tags.
* `XHTML` tag names must be in lowercase.
* `XHTML` documents must have a root element.
* `XHTML` tag order must be correct.
* `XHTML` documents require all attributes to have a value, and attribute values cannot be abbreviated.
* `XHTML` requires all attributes to be enclosed in double quotation marks (`""`).
* `XHTML` documents need to encode special characters such as `<`, `>`, `&`, etc.
* `XHTML` documents cannot use `--` in comment content.
* `XHTML` images must have alt text.
* `XHTML` documents use the `id` attribute instead of the `name` attribute.

## Hybrid Applications
* `XHTML` can incorporate various `XML` applications, such as `MathML` and `SVG`.
* `HTML4.0` cannot incorporate other `XML` applications, but in `HTML5`, it is possible to embed applications such as `MathML` and `SVG`.
