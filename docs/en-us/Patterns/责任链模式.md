    When an account is set with three payment methods: bank, paypal, and bitcoin,
    with balances of 100RMB, 200RMB, and 300RMB respectively, 
    the payment priority is bank, then paypal, and finally bitcoin.
    When trying to purchase something worth 251RMB using the Chain of Responsibility pattern, 
    first, the bank account is checked for purchase eligibility. If eligible, the purchase is made and the chain is broken. 
    If not, the request will move on to the paypal account to check if the amount is sufficient. 
    If it is, the purchase will be made and the chain will be broken. 
    Otherwise, the request will continue to be forwarded until a suitable handler is found. 
    Here, bank, paypal, and bitcoin serve as links in the chain, 
    and the entire phenomenon is the responsibility chain.
