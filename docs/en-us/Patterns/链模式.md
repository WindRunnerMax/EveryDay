# Chain Pattern
The chain pattern is a way of calling methods in a chained manner. It does not belong to the category of the generally defined `23` design patterns, but is usually considered as a broadly categorized technique design pattern.

## Description
Chained calls are very common in the `JavaScript` language, such as in `jQuery`, `Promise`, etc., all of which use chained calls. When we need to access the properties or methods of the same object multiple times, we often have to write the object multiple times for the `.` or `()` operations. Chained calls are a way to simplify this process, making the code concise and readable.  
There are usually several ways to implement chained calls, but fundamentally they are similar, all by returning objects for later calls.  
* The scope chain of `this`, which is the implementation method of `jQuery`, is usually the method used for chained calls.
* Returning the object itself, unlike `this`, explicitly returns the chained object.
* Implementation through closure to return objects, which is similar to currying.

```javascript
var Person = function() {};
Person.prototype.setAge = function(age){
    this.age = age; 
    return this;
}
Person.prototype.setWeight = function(weight){
    this.weight = weight; 
    return this;
}
Person.prototype.get = function(){
    return `{age: ${this.age}, weight: ${this.weight}}`;
}

var person = new Person();
var des = person.setAge(10).setWeight(30).get();
console.log(des); // {age: 10, weight: 30}
```

```javascript
var person = {
    age: null,
    weight: null,
    setAge: function(age){
        this.age = age; 
        return this;
    },
    setWeight: function(weight){
        this.weight = weight; 
        return this;
    },
    get: function(){
        return `{age: ${this.age}, weight: ${this.weight}}`;
    }
};
var des = person.setAge(10).setWeight(30).get();
console.log(des); // {age: 10, weight: 30}
```

```javascript
function numsChain(num){
    var nums = num;
    function chain(num){
        nums = `${nums} -> ${num}`;
        return chain;
    }
    chain.get = () => nums;
    return chain;
}
var des = numsChain(1)(2)(3).get();
console.log(des); // 1 -> 2 -> 3
```


## Optional Chaining Operator
When it comes to chained calls, it is necessary to mention the optional chaining operator in `JavaScript`, which is part of the new `ES2020` features, including operators such as `?.`, `??`, and `??=`. The optional chaining operator `?.` allows reading the value of a property deep within an object chain without having to explicitly validate each reference in the chain. The `?.` operator functions similarly to the `.` chaining operator, but the difference is that it does not cause an error when the reference is `nullish`, i.e., `null` or `undefined`, and the expression short-circuits to return the value of `undefined`. When used with function calls, if the given function does not exist, it returns `undefined`. When attempting to access a property of an object that may not exist, the optional chaining operator makes the expression shorter and more concise. It is also very helpful when exploring the content of an object if it is uncertain which properties must exist.

### Syntax

```javascript
obj?.prop
obj?.[expr]
arr?.[index]
func?.(args)
```

### Examples
```javascript
const obj = {a: {}};
console.log(obj.a); // {}
console.log(obj.a.b); // undefined
// console.log(obj.a.b.c); // Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'c' of undefined
console.log(obj && obj.a); // {}
console.log(obj && obj.a && obj.a.b && obj.a.b.c); // undefined
console.log(obj?.a?.b?.c); // undefined
```

```javascript
const test = void 0;
const prop = "a";
console.log(test); // undefined
console.log(test?.a); // undefined
console.log(test?.[prop]); // undefined
console.log(test?.[0]); // undefined
console.log(test?.()); // undefined
```

## Chained Calls in jQuery

`jQuery` is a high-end but luxurious framework with many wonderful methods and logic. Although it is not as popular now as `MVVM`-mode frameworks like `Vue` and `React`, the design of `jQuery` is great and definitely worth learning. Let's take the most basic instantiation of `jQuery` as an example here to explore how `jQuery` achieves chained calls using `this`.

First, let's define a basic class and use the prototype chain to inherit methods.

```javascript
function _jQuery(){}
_jQuery.prototype = {
    constructor: _jQuery,
    length: 2,
    size: function(){
        return this.length;
    }
}

var instance = new _jQuery();
console.log(instance.size()); // 2
// _jQuery.size() // Uncaught TypeError: _jQuery.size is not a function
// _jQuery().size() / /Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'size' of undefined
```

By defining a class and instantiating it, the instances can share methods on the prototype, but calling methods directly on the `_jQuery` class obviously won't work. The first type of exception thrown is because there are no static methods on the `_jQuery` class, and the second type of exception is because `_jQuery` as a function call didn't return a value. Here we can see that when calling `jQuery` via `$()`, it returns an object containing multiple methods, which we cannot access directly. We have to use another variable to access it.

```javascript
function _jQuery(){
    return  _fn;
}
var _fn = _jQuery.prototype = {
    constructor: _jQuery,
    length: 2,
    size: function(){
        return this.length;
    }
}
console.log(_jQuery().size()); // 2
```

Actually, in order to reduce variable creation, `jQuery` directly treats `_fn` as a property of `_jQuery`.

```javascript
function _jQuery(){
    return  _jQuery.fn;
}
_jQuery.fn = _jQuery.prototype = {
    constructor: _jQuery,
    length: 2,
    size: function(){
        return this.length;
    }
}
console.log(_jQuery().size()); // 2
```

So far, it can indeed achieve the invocation of methods on the prototype via `_jQuery()`, but in `jQuery`, the main purpose of `$()` is to be used as a selector to select elements, and what is currently returned is an `_jQuery.fn` object, which is obviously not what we want. In order to obtain the returned elements, we need to define an `init` method on the prototype to obtain the elements. Here, for simplicity, we directly use `document.querySelector`, while in reality, the construction of the `jQuery` selector is much more complex.

```javascript
function _jQuery(selector){
    return  _jQuery.fn.init(selector);
}
_jQuery.fn = _jQuery.prototype = {
    constructor: _jQuery,
    init: function(selector){
        return document.querySelector(selector);
    },
    length: 3,
    size: function(){
        return this.length;
    }
}
console.log(_jQuery("body")); // <body>...</body>
```

But it seems like this leaves out the chained call of `this`, so we need to use the pointing of `this`. Since `this` always points to the object that calls it, we just need to mount the selected element on the `this` object here.

```javascript
function _jQuery(selector){
    return  _jQuery.fn.init(selector);
}
_jQuery.fn = _jQuery.prototype = {
    constructor: _jQuery,
    init: function(selector){
        this[0] = document.querySelector(selector);
        this.length = 1;
        return this;
    },
    length: 3,
    size: function(){
        return this.length;
    }
}
var body = _jQuery("body");
console.log(body); // {0: body, length: 1, constructor: ƒ, init: ƒ, size: ƒ}
console.log(body.size()); // 1
console.log(_jQuery.fn); // {0: body, length: 1, constructor: ƒ, init: ƒ, size: ƒ}
```

But then a problem emerged. The elements selected by our selector are directly attached to `_jQuery.fn`. In this way, since the prototype is shared, subsequently defined selectors will overwrite the ones defined earlier. This obviously won't work. So, we use the `new` operator to create a new object.

```javascript
function _jQuery(selector){
    return new _jQuery.fn.init(selector);
}
_jQuery.fn = _jQuery.prototype = {
    constructor: _jQuery,
    init: function(selector){
        this[0] = document.querySelector(selector);
        this.length = 1;
        return this;
    },
    length: 3,
    size: function(){
        return this.length;
    }
}
var body = _jQuery("body");
console.log(body); // init {0: body, length: 1}
// console.log(body.size()); // Uncaught TypeError: body.size is not a function
```

This introduced another issue. When we use `new` to instantiate `_jQuery.fn.init`, the `this` returned points to the instance of `_jQuery.fn.init`, which prevents us from making chained calls. `jQuery` used a very clever method to solve this problem by directly pointing the prototype of `_jQuery.fn.init` to `_jQuery.prototype`. Although there might be a problem of circular reference, the performance overhead is not significant. Thus, we have completed the implementation of the `jQuery` selector and chained calls.

```javascript
function _jQuery(selector){
    return new _jQuery.fn.init(selector);
}
_jQuery.fn = _jQuery.prototype = {
    constructor: _jQuery,
    init: function(selector){
        this[0] = document.querySelector(selector);
        this.length = 1;
        return this;
    },
    length: 3,
    size: function(){
        return this.length;
    }
}
_jQuery.fn.init.prototype = _jQuery.fn;
var body = _jQuery("body");
console.log(body); // init {0: body, length: 1}
console.log(body.size()); // 1
console.log(_jQuery.fn.init.prototype.init.prototype.init.prototype === _jQuery.fn); // true
```
