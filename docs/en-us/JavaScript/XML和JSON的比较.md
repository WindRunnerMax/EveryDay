# Comparison of XML and JSON
`XML` and `JSON` can both be used to describe or store data, each with its own advantages. The choice of which to use depends on the specific requirements.

## Description

### XML
`XML`, short for `Extensible Markup Language`, is a language for marking up electronic documents to give them a structural representation. It can be used to mark data, define data types, and store data. `XML` allows users to define their own markup language and provides a unified way to describe and exchange structured data independent of applications or vendors. It has evolved from the Standard Generalized Markup Language (`SGML`) and HyperText Markup Language (`HTML`), using Document Type Definition (`DTD`) to organize data. `XML` is platform and language agnostic, and the current standard version is `XML 1.0`.

### JSON
`JSON`, or `JavaScript Object Notation`, is a lightweight data interchange format and a subset of the `ECMAScript` specification. It uses a highly compatible, completely language-independent text format to store and represent data, and the concise and clear hierarchical structure makes `JSON` an ideal data exchange language. It is easy to read and write and is also easily interpreted and generated by machines, effectively enhancing network transmission efficiency.

## Comparison

### Readability
In terms of readability, both `JSON` and `XML` are standard specifications and are relatively easy to read. They largely depend on the application scenario. For complete mapping of `XML` to `JSON` format, `XML` is slightly more readable. However, for simple data description, their readability is comparable.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<block name="show" >
    <content>Hello World</content>
</block>
```

```javascript
{
    tag: "block",
    name: "show",
    children:[
        {
            tag: "content",
            children:[
                "Hello World"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

### Extensibility
Both `XML` and `JSON` have good extensibility. There is nothing that `XML` can extend while `JSON` cannot, and vice versa.

### Encoding Difficulty
Both `XML` and `JSON` have abundant encoding tools. However, even without tools, encoding the corresponding format in `JSON` is relatively easy, while encoding in `XML` without tools is more difficult.

### Data Volume
`XML` data format is more redundant than `JSON`, generally `XML` is more suitable for markup documents, while `JSON` is more suitable for data exchange processing.

### Data Parsing
Both `XML` and `JSON` have abundant parsing tools. For `XML`, there are two parsing methods: `DOM` and `SAX`. `DOM` loads the entire `XML` into memory for full parsing, while `SAX` is a progressive parsing method that processes the content gradually without needing to load the entire `XML`. `SAX` is suitable for parsing large documents. `JSON` only provides whole parsing solutions and works better for documents with smaller data volume.

### Data Interaction
For `JSON` data format, many languages provide support in their standard libraries. One can directly call library functions for parsing. Particularly for front-end applications, `JSON` is a subset of the `ECMAScript` specification and integrates more conveniently with `JavaScript`. It is widely used in front-end applications. On the other hand, parsing `XML` data format generally requires third-party library support.
