# Lenovo's Autumn Campus Recruitment Officially Conducts Front-end Interviews

I want to express my gratitude to any company that gave me the opportunity to interview, and I want to thank Lenovo. I submitted my resume around noon on `2022.08.06` and got a referral from a friend for a position in Tianjin. The written test was scheduled for `2022.08.08 23:00`, and of course, the test time was flexible, so I decided to do it after work and completed it.

## First Interview
After nearly a month of waiting, I finally got the chance to interview. I scheduled the interview for around `14:00` on `2022.08.31` and actually had the interview on `2022.09.05 10:30`. I arrived five minutes early, and the interview experience was very pleasant. The interviewer started by introducing the department, which was the first time I had encountered such treatment after so many interviews. The entire interview lasted about `30 minutes`.

* What technology stack did you mainly use during your internship?
* What was your main responsibility during your internship at Tencent?
* How did you complete unit testing?
* Describe the general development process and communication.
* How did you implement the live broadcasting feature and what optimizations did you make?
* How did you balance compatibility and performance?
* How did you optimize the initial page loading?
* What was your strategy for splitting page chunks?
* What's the difference between splitting the basic library via CDN and fully packaged deployment via CDN?
* How did you fully utilize caching strategies?
* Did you develop this mini-program completely on your own?
* What was your biggest gain while working on this mini-program?
* What differences did you notice when using TypeScript compared to JavaScript?
* Briefly explain how Vue and React work.
* The process of refreshing the view through data in Vue and React.
* Future development directions and plans.

The interview experience was really good; the interviewer was punctual and began with self-introduction and business overview. This was a kind of treatment I had never experienced in previous interviews. Moreover, at the end, the interviewer spent at least five minutes discussing Lenovo's internal business. During the follow-up questions, I also asked about some of the business-related aspects mentioned by the interviewer. Overall, the interview experience was really positive, and my recent interview experiences have been quite good. Each one had its own unique features, haha.

## Second Interview
The second interview was scheduled for around `17:12` on `2022.09.15`. It was directly scheduled via email for a fixed time, and the actual interview was set for` 2022.09.20 16:00`. This time, a lady conducted the interview, and it lasted approximately `28 minutes`. I have to say, Lenovo's interview experience is really good. However, there was a bit of awkwardness when the email suggested `14:00`, but the Teams meeting was being scheduled for `16:00`. I had to send an email to clarify, hahaha. Additionally, I had some issues with my internet connection and had to switch to mobile data after getting disconnected three times during the interview.

* What are your plans for the next three to five years?
* What are some of the recent projects you've worked on?
* What motivated you to develop this mini-program?
* Did you handle the front-end, back-end, and cloud server deployment all by yourself?
* Which project left the deepest impression on you and why?
* What led you to work on this project?
* How do you view collaboration and completing projects together?
* What are your plans for the development of your interested technical areas?
* Your understanding of agile development.
* Which internship experience was more fulfilling for you?
* Your impression of Lenovo.
* Some important points to consider when choosing a company base location.

The Lenovo interview experience was really good. We chatted with a lot of smiles throughout. During the follow-up questions, I first asked if the department would be determined by HR later and then inquired about some business-related aspects. After that, we delved into a long discussion about Lenovo's platform business, as well as exchanged views on some of the business aspects that I am particularly interested in. In conclusion, the interview experience was really great.

## Follow-up
I didn't pass, hahaha. On `2022.09.21 14:42`, I received a thank-you letter. Although the interview experience at Lenovo was great, I didn't make it to the next stage, which is quite normal. After all, given the situation this year, I've gotten used to being rejected. Nonetheless, I am very grateful for the interview opportunity provided by Lenovo, and I truly had a good interview experience.
