# Ctrip autumn recruitment official interview for front-end batch
The resume was submitted around `2022.09.11 20:00`, and the written test was scheduled for `2022.09.13 14:00`. I've heard that working at Ctrip is quite comfortable. I've been wanting to interview at Ctrip for a while now, so I'm grateful for the opportunity.

## First Interview
My condition after the National Day was indeed not great, feeling quite listless, which made the interview a bit perplexing. I received the interview invitation email around `2022.10.10 18:35`, with the option to choose the time. I chose the interview time to be `2022.10.12 15:20`, and the interview lasted about `25 minutes`.

* Introduction of the project, the difficulties encountered in the project, and how they were resolved.
* Screen sharing for a permutation problem.
* Binding events to the `a` tag and creating a hyperlink, and the expected action upon clicking.
* If the `a` tag is nested within a `div`, and you want the `div` event to be triggered first, how would you achieve that?
* The difference between `align-items` and `align-content` in the `flex` layout.
* How to make images adapt to the layout using the `object-fit` property.
* Any practical experience in code quality prompts and standards.
* Approaches for optimizing page performance, especially focused on first-screen optimization.

This was the quickest interview I had during the autumn recruitment, lasting only `25 minutes`, followed by about seven to eight minutes for solving questions. During the questioning phase, I inquired about specific departments and sought advice. The department mainly deals with flight tickets, and the advice I received was to delve deeper into performance optimization. Overall, the interview experience was quite good.

## Second Interview
The second interview invitation was sent around `2022.10.18 18:50`, and I chose the interview time to be `2022.10.21 15:20`. The interviewer was very friendly and kept the conversation about technology and ideas light-hearted throughout the interview, creating an extremely positive interview experience. The interview lasted about `35 minutes`.

* Introduction of the Shanke Small Station mini-program project.
* How is data request resilience achieved and how many routes are there?
* How is the data crawled and processed?
* How was this script implemented and what are its main features?
* Why did you decide to work on this rich text project?
* Thoughts on future development directions.
* Insights into cross-platform development.
* How to choose the framework for cross-platform requirements in mini-programs.
* Understanding of `Node` for server-side development, and its advantages.

Although the interview took some time, the number of questions was relatively fewer because we discussed a wide range of topics. I felt that this was the best interview experience I had during the autumn recruitment. The interviewer was really friendly and approachable. During the questioning phase, I asked about the department's related business and received well-placed advice for future development directions, emphasizing the importance of following one's heart and pursuing what one desires, which felt very relatable and spot-on. Overall, it was a very good interview experience, and I am very grateful for it.

## HR Interview
The HR interview invitation was sent around `2022.10.25 14:37`, and the interview was scheduled for `2022.09.26 15:00`. The interviewer was a lovely lady, and I am very thankful for the opportunity provided by Ctrip. The interview lasted about `11 minutes`.

* When did you switch majors and what led to this decision?
* Notable achievements during your time at school.
* What did you learn during your two internship periods?
* Your strengths and weaknesses.
* Why did you choose Ctrip?
* Knowledge about Ctrip as a company.
* Some questions about third-party aspects.

This interview was relatively short as well. During the questioning phase, I mainly asked about the possibility of being reassigned and when the results would be available. It seems that there won't be any reassignment in Ctrip, and the results will likely be available after an English test in about two weeks. Just have to wait and see how it goes!

## Follow-Up
Ctrip is my third preference for this year's autumn recruitment. A direct `OC` to send the `offer` on `2022.11.04 19:00`, and then sent the formal `offer` on `2022.11.07 20:35`. The offer really got me excited; I heard that it's not overly demanding and tiring, with two days of `WFH` every week. Thinking about it makes me feel great!
