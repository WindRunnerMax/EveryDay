# Pinduoduo Autumn Recruitment Official Front-end Interview Experience

I submitted my resume in the afternoon around `15:00` on `2022.08.20`, and then the written test was on `2022.09.03 15:00`. I appreciate Pinduoduo for giving me the opportunity for an interview.

## First Interview
The first interview was scheduled around `2022.09.13 14:34`, and the interview time was fixed by email. The actual interview was scheduled for `2022.09.15 19:00`. The internet connection was good initially, but I experienced some network issues in the middle, possibly due to the typhoon in the area. The interview lasted about `51 minutes`.

The interviewer asked me various questions related to recent projects, the implementation of rich text editors, comparison of current rich text engines, specific implementations of grid layout, and more. The interviewer was knowledgeable and the conversation was quite extensive. Despite my frequent internet disconnection, the interview experience was still quite good.

## Second Interview
The second interview was scheduled around `2022.09.16 19:40`, and the actual interview was set for `2022.09.22 14:00`. The interview was scheduled promptly, and it lasted about `50 minutes`.

The interview focused on topics such as finding the maximum non-repeating substring from the end, differences between CSS pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements, non-inheritable CSS styles, asynchronous loading of JavaScript using `defer` and `async`, relationship between `Promise` and `async/await` in JavaScript, among other technical questions. The technical challenge initially caught me off guard, and subsequently, the other questions were comparatively challenging. Nevertheless, the overall interview experience was satisfactory.

## Third Interview
After a long wait following the second interview, I received an email for the third round of interview around `2022.10.11 17:45`. The actual interview was scheduled for `2022-10-18 14:00`, and it lasted about `30 minutes`.

The interviewer inquired about my most accomplished achievements during the internship, the `NoCode` project, advantages over similar competitive products, considerations in the selection of rich text engine, and more. I faced a challenging question during the technical challenge, which had me stumped. Despite the difficulty, the interview was insightful.

## HR Interview
Surprisingly, despite my unsuccessful attempt in the third interview, I was given the opportunity for an HR interview. I received the interview invitation around `2022.10.27 10:32`, and the interview, initially planned to be a video call, turned into a phone interview. The interview lasted about `21 minutes`.

The interviewer mainly provided me with information about the company and asked questions about my understanding of Pinduoduo, my internship experiences at Tencent and ByteDance, the current autumn recruitment situation, and other relevant topics. The interviewer was quite accommodating, and the conversation was smooth.

## Follow-up
Pinduoduo was my fourth intention for this autumn recruitment. I received the intention letter on `2022.11.14 14:31`, and then the official offer was extended on `2022.11.18 16:09`. Pinduoduo's recent international expansion efforts and its dominance in the low-end market indicate promising growth prospects. Overall, the experience with Pinduoduo has been quite positive.
