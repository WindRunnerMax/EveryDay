# Meituan Summer Internship Front-end Interview

This time I was interviewed by the Platform Technology Department of Meituan's In-store Business Group. After submitting my application on `March 1st, 2022`, I directly participated in the first unified written test for the internship recruitment at Meituan. Because Meituan requires a written test to be completed first before proceeding to the next stage, the written test was scheduled for `10:00 AM on March 5th, 2022`. This time I did better than last year when I was searching for an internship. At least this time I scored an `A` on one question, while last year at this time it was a `0AC`, haha.

## First Interview Round
After two days of the written test, on Monday afternoon, a senior colleague called me to schedule an interview. We originally scheduled it for `7:00 PM on March 9th, 2022`, but on that evening, due to nucleic acid testing related to the epidemic situation in Shanghai, the interview was delayed by an hour, so it took place at `8:00 PM on March 9th, 2022`, lasting for about `62 minutes`. This senior colleague was very polite. Throughout the first interview round, we chatted like buddies, discussing various topics. We kept laughing, and in the end, I didn't even know what to write in the interview summary.

* Recently researched aspects of new front-end knowledge.
* The advantages of `Promise` and what problems it solves.
* How to implement the cancellation of requests when encapsulating `Promise` requests.
* Cross-domain handling solutions for `Cookie`.
* Understanding of JavaScript modularization and the rationale for modularization.
* The difference between closure and modularization.
* Strong caching and conditional caching, with specific practical applications.
* The difference between `opacity` and transparent `rgba`.
* Reasons for using `Vuex` over `EventBus` and the differences from `Mobx`.
* Transitioning to TypeScript development.
* Selecting a framework when starting a new project.
* Specifics of unit testing your own projects.
* Differences between `Vue2` and `Vue3`.
* First screen optimization strategies and metrics.
* Implementing a handwritten `Promise`.
* Finding the indexes of duplicate numbers in an array.
* Ranking of atmosphere, city, environment, development, and salary.

The senior colleague's interview was quite interesting. It can be said that the questions asked started from the basics and then delved into practical applications. In other words, all the questions ultimately led to how I dealt with them in my projects. There were no specific routines to follow. Although the senior colleague asked many things, I simply couldn't remember all of them. In the end, the summarization turned out to be just above this point. In the end, the colleague even gave me an extra task, asking me to write the `Promise/A+` specification. I said I couldn't do it and asked for a different topic. The colleague agreed and exchanged it for the simpler question above, hahaha. Overall, the senior colleague was quite interesting and easy to talk to. It was truly a different kind of interview, which was quite good. After inquiring about the specific department from a senior colleague who referred me, it turned out that I was assigned to the Instore Comprehensive Business Department.

## Second Interview Round
I scheduled the second interview for `March 11th, 2022`. This second interview caught me off guard, and my responses became increasingly disorganized. Without any surprises, I probably didn't make it. The interview took place on `March 15th, 2022` and lasted for about `37 minutes`.

* What did I do in that software competition and what level of competition was it.
* What did I learn during the internship period.
* How did I implement the live streaming feature during the internship.
* Challenges encountered when encapsulating components.
* Implementation strategies for first screen optimization.
* Evaluation metrics after page optimization.
* Understanding of design patterns.
* Practical applications of the decorator pattern in frontend development.
* How do TypeScript decorators work.
* How is Java reflection implemented.
* Concepts of `IOC` and `AOP` in `SpringBoot`.
* Practical applications of `IOC` and `AOP` in frontend development.
* Understanding of frontend modularization and componentization.
* How to encapsulate components and abstract logic.
* How to independently abstract data, UI, and logic.
* What is the purpose of `uniapp` framework and how is it implemented.
* My usual learning methods.

This interview was the most challenging one I have faced so far. The more I spoke, the more disorganized I became, and in the end, I was a bit incoherent. These questions really caught me off guard. Finally, I asked the senior colleague for advice. Similarly, the senior colleague advised me that although my knowledge base is relatively broad, I should strive to gain a deeper understanding of the knowledge. It was the same advice I received from the ByteDance second round interviewer. I indeed need to reflect on this issue.

## Follow-up
I didn't make it, haha. On `March 18th, 2022, 3:16 PM`, I received a thank-you letter. This is the first thank-you letter I have received in my life. Usually, it's either a rejection or there's no response after being rejected. In this regard, Meituan really did a good job. Today, many of my fellow interviewees received thank-you letters as well. It turns out they were all sent uniformly. So, they all received thank-you letters. I couldn't hold my laughter, hahaha.
