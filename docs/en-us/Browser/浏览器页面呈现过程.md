# Browser page rendering process
The process that a browser goes through from entering a link to rendering the page.

## DNS resolution
First, the browser performs a `DNS` resolution on the entered link, which is the process of converting a domain name to an `IP` address, obtaining the specific `IP` address of the server and enabling `TCP` connection and data transmission.   
In the specific `DNS` resolution process, the browser first checks its own `DNS` cache for the `IP` address of the domain name. In `Chrome`, the caching time for domain name resolution is `60s`, and the `DNS` cache can be cleared by entering `chrome://net-internals/#dns` in the address bar. If the browser's cache does not have a hit, it then checks the domain-name-to-`IP` mapping in the operating system's `hosts` file. If there is no hit in the `hosts` file, it then requests resolution from the local domain name server, which is generally provided by the internet service provider (`ISP`) and typically sends `UDP` datagram requests to the server for `DNS` resolution through port `53`. If the local server resolution does not yield a hit, there are two resolution methods: iterative resolution and recursive resolution. Generally, the host's query to the local domain name server is a recursive query, and the local domain name server's query to the root domain name server is typically an iterative query, querying from the root domain name server, top-level domain name server, primary domain name server, etc., level by level, until it finds the `IP` address.

## TCP three-way handshake
The `HTTP` protocol uses the `TCP` protocol as its transport layer protocol. After obtaining the server's `IP` address, the client browser establishes a `TCP` connection with the server, a process that involves a three-way handshake.  
```
client                                      server
actively open →          SYN=1,seq=x          → passively open, receive
(synchronize sent)                             (synchronize received)
receive         ←   SYN=1,ACK=1,seq=y,ack=x+1   ← send
(connection established)                             (synchronize received)
send          →      ACK=1,seq=x+1,ack=y+1    →  receive
(connection established)                             (connection established)
``` 
1. First handshake: The client actively connects to the server, sends the initial sequence number `seq=x` and the `SYN=1` synchronization request flag, and enters the `SYN_SENT` state, waiting for confirmation from the server.
2. Second handshake: After receiving the message, the server sends the acknowledgment flag `ACK=1` and the synchronization request flag `SYN=1`, sends its own sequence number `seq=y` and the client's acknowledgment number `ack=x+1`, at this point the server enters the `SYN_RECV` state.
3. Third handshake: After receiving the message, the client sends the acknowledgment flag `ACK=1`, sends its own sequence number `seq=x+1` and the server's acknowledgment number `ack=y+1`, and after sending, the connection is confirmed to be in the `ESTABLISHED` state, and the server enters the `ESTABLISHED` state upon receiving the confirmation information.

## SSL Encryption Transmission
The establishment of `SSL` is for the encrypted transmission of `HTTPS`. `HTTPS` adds the `SSL` layer on the basis of `HTTP`, and the security foundation of `HTTPS` is `SSL`, so the details of the encryption require `SSL`.  
1. First, the `TCP` three-way handshake establishes the connection, which is the foundation of data transmission, and then `SSL` starts.
2. The client first sends `Client Hello` to start the `SSL` communication. The message contains the `SSL` version supported by the client, a random value `Random1`, encryption algorithm, and key length.
3. The server sends `Server Hello`, which, like the client, includes the `SSL` version, random value `Random2`, and encryption components. The server then sends the certificate to the client.
4. At this point, the client needs to verify the certificate sent by the server. By using the built-in `CA` certificate of the operating system, the client decrypts the digital signature of the server's certificate and compares the public key of the certificate with the same algorithm's `HASH` and the decrypted content of the digital signature, verifying whether the certificate is valid and legitimate or whether it has been hijacked and replaced.
5. The client verifies the certificate as valid, then generates a random value `Random3`, encrypts it with the public key, generates the `Pre-Master Key`, and sends the `Pre-Master Key` to the server in a `Client Key Exchange` message. Then it sends a `Change Cipher Spec` message to indicate that subsequent data transmission will be encrypted.
6. The server decrypts the `Pre-Master Key` with its private key to get `Random3`, and then sends a `Change Cipher Spec` message to indicate that subsequent data transmission will be encrypted.
7. At this point, both the client and the server have three random strings, and `Random3` is transmitted in ciphertext, which is in a secure state, and these three strings can then be used for symmetrically encrypted transmission. Asymmetric encryption is slow and cannot be used for every data transmission, so it is used to negotiate the key and then use symmetric encryption for data transmission.
8. At this point, normal `HTTP` data transmission can occur, but due to the effect of `SSL` encryption, the `HTTP` transmission at this point is secure. This is the process of `HTTPS` transmission, where steps `2`, `3`, `5`, and `6` are also known as the `SSL` four-way handshake.

## Initiating Requests
The browser constructs an `HTTP` request message and transmits it to the server's specified port via the `TCP` protocol. An `HTTP` request message consists of three parts: the message header, usually containing the request line and various request header fields; a blank line (telling the server that the request header ends here); and the message body, which contains the transmitted data and is not necessarily required.

```
<!-- Message header -->
GET / HTTP/1.1 <!-- Request line -->
accept: text/html
accept-encoding: gzip, deflate, br
accept-language: zh-CN, zh;q=0.9 
... <!-- Request header -->
<!-- Blank line -->

<!-- Message body -->
u=1&t=1587699008
```

## Response Message
The server responds to the `HTTP` request by returning a response message, which consists of four parts: the response line, response header, blank line, and response body.

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK <!-- Response line -->
content-encoding: gzip
content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8
date: Fri, 24 Apr 2020 03:34:50 GMT
... <!-- Response header -->
<!-- Blank line -->

<!-- Response body -->
{"status":1, "msg": "success"}
```

## Rendering a Web Page
1. From top to bottom, the `HTML` tags are first parsed to generate the `DOM Tree`.
2. When parsing encounters a `<link>` or `<style>` tag, the `CSS` is parsed to generate the `CSSOM`. It's worth noting that at this point, parsing of `HTML` tags and `CSS` is executed in parallel.
3. When a `<script>` tag is encountered, the browser immediately begins script parsing, halting the document parsing. This is because scripts may modify the `DOM` and `CSS`, and continuing parsing would waste resources. Therefore, `<script>` tags should be placed after the `<body></body>`.
4. Once the `DOM Tree` and `CSSOM` are generated, they are merged to perform layout, calculating their size, position, and layout information to form an internal representation model that can represent all this information, known as the render tree.
5. The entire page is drawn based on the calculated information. The system traverses the render tree and invokes the `paint` method to display the content on the screen.

## Terminating a TCP Connection
```
client                                      server
Active close →         FIN=1,seq=u         → Passive close, receive
(LAST-ACK)                                  (CLOSE-WAIT)
Receive     ←      ACK=1,seq=v,ack=u+1     ← Send
(TIME-WAIT)                                (CLOSED)
Receive     ←   FIN=1,ACK=1,seq=w,ack=u+1  ← Send
(CLOSED)                                   (CLOSED)
Send       →      ACK=1,seq=u+1,ack=w+1    → Receive
(CLOSED)                                   (CLOSED)
```
1. First handshake: The client sends a release indication `FIN=1`, its own sequence number `seq=u`, and enters the terminated waiting `FIN-WAIT-1` state.
2. Second handshake: After receiving the message, the server sends `ACK=1` acknowledgment flag and the client's acknowledgment number `ack=u+1`, its own sequence number `seq=v`, and enters the closed waiting `CLOSE-WAIT` state. The client enters the terminated waiting `FIN-WAIT-2` state upon receiving the message.
3. Third handshake: The server sends the release indication `FIN=1` signal, acknowledgment flag `ACK=1`, acknowledgment number `ack=u+1`, its own sequence number `seq=w`, and transitions to the last acknowledgment `LAST-ACK` state.
4. Fourth handshake: Upon receiving the reply, the client sends the acknowledgment flag `ACK=1`, acknowledgment number `ack=w+1`, its own sequence number `seq=u+1`, and enters the time waiting `TIME-WAIT` state. After `2` maximum segment lifetimes, the client `CLOSE`s. Upon receiving the acknowledgment, the server immediately enters the `CLOSE` state.
