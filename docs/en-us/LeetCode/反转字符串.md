# Reverse String

Write a function to reverse the input string. The input string is given as an array of characters `char[]`.  
Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must modify the input array in-place with `O(1)` extra memory.  
You may assume that all the characters in the array are printable ASCII characters.

## Example

```
Input: ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
```

```
Input: ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
```

## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {character[]} s
 * @return {void} Do not return anything, modify s in-place instead.
 */
var reverseString = function(s) {
    var n = s.length;
    for(let i=0; i<n/2; ++i){
        [s[i], s[n-i-1]] = [s[n-i-1], s[i]];
    }
    return void 0;
};
```

## Idea
For the in-place reverse of an array, we can directly reverse it based on the index. First, define `n` as the length of the array, and then define a loop. Since we only need to swap `N/2` times, we set the termination condition to `n/2`. Then, use the destructuring assignment defined by the `ES6` standard to directly swap the values of the index positions of the array traversal loop and the `i-th` index position from the end to the front. The problem requires an in-place reverse, so just return `void 0`.
