# Baidu Intern Frontend Interview
This interview is for the frontend internship position in the Industry Innovation Business Department of the ACG Baidu Intelligent Cloud Division. Back then, it was Haize, a senior colleague, who was looking for people in the group, so I sent in my resume to see if I could intern during the winter break.

## First Round
The first round was scheduled for `15:00 on 2020.11.10`. The interviewer, a young lady, was quite pretty, haha. But I was still nervous, I mean, it had been so long since I last interacted with an interviewer. The interview lasted for about 50 minutes. The interviewer's computer ran out of battery, and I had to send her the last curried programming question I had solved. Man, I was so nervous that my typing went all wonky. However, I think I did alright. Despite being a bit nervous and stumbling over my words, I managed to answer most of the questions. Once I was done with the first round, Haize told me that the second round would be scheduled in a few days. These are the questions I could recall from the interview. There might be some that I can't remember, but I have basically covered them in my blog. However, the explanations in my blog are quite lengthy, so you may want to take a look at it. Additionally, make sure to frequently read my blog because I tend to forget what I have written before.

- Implement a three-column layout using `flex`, `position`, and `float`, and share the code on the screen.
- The difference between `fixed` and `absolute` in positioning.
- Basic data types in JavaScript.
- The role of the `Symbol` data type in JavaScript.
- Differences between `let`, `const`, and `var` in ES6.
- The purpose of the `Promise` object and the role of `async` and `await`.
- Ways to implement inheritance in ES5 and ES6 in JavaScript, and write the code.
- Understanding of the scope, prototype chain, and closures in JavaScript.
- Methods to determine data types in JavaScript and their differences.
- Characteristics of the HTTP2.0 protocol.
- The purpose of `options` in HTTP requests, simple requests and complex requests, and cross-origin issues.
- Browser caching mechanisms, the request headers used to control them, the values of the `Cache-Control` property, and the distinction between strong caching and conditional caching.
- The principles of `XSS` and `CSRF` attacks and how to avoid them.
- Understanding of the `MVVM` pattern.
- The lifecycle of Vue and when they are triggered.
- The purpose of the `key` attribute in Vue loops. I probably shouldn't have mentioned the `diff` algorithm because I didn't thoroughly study it, and I ended up digging a hole for myself.
- The `diff` algorithm in Vue: breadth-first search or depth-first search.
- Methods for parent-child component communication in Vue.
- How data two-way binding is achieved in Vue and the differences between `2.0` and `3.0`.
- How Vue-Router implements routing and the differences between `Hash` mode and `History` mode.
- Programming: Write a program to flatten an array, remove duplicate elements, and obtain a non-repeating ascending array.
- Programming: Implement `plus(1)(2)(3)(4)` to equal `8`.

## Missed Opportunity
The second round was scheduled for `2020-11-16`, but it turned out that there was actually no second round. They call it the "second round", but in reality, there wasn't one. Let's just call it a "vermicelli" round. Initially, there was supposed to be a second round, but they changed their minds. Then Haize told me that they were looking for someone who could receive an offer, to be more precise, someone who could receive a formal offer upon graduation next year. Well, I'm a first-year postgraduate, so I'm clearly not qualified. It seems like they are actually looking for autumn recruitment, but they don't want someone like me for an internship. So, my self-esteem took a hit, haha.

When the first round ended, they told me to wait for a second round, and then this happened - I was taken aback.

Also, I casually asked about the number of frontend resumes received as compared to backend, and Haize mentioned that in terms of future promotion, front-end roles might not have a significant advantage. However, after spending so much time learning frontend development, switching to backend might not be suitable for me. Who knows, maybe I'll end up doing `C++` in the end.

It's really tough to get into a Big Tech company. Back when I applied for an internship at Alibaba, I didn't make it through. Now, Baidu has turned me down for an internship too. I'm really having a hard time.
