# Browser Rendering and Kernel

The browser kernel can be divided into two parts: rendering engine and `JS` engine. Initially, the rendering engine and `JS` engine were not clearly distinguished, but as the `JS` engine became more independent, the kernel tended to refer only to the rendering engine.

## Rendering Process
Different browser kernels have different rendering methods, but the overall process is basically the same:

1. From top to bottom, firstly parse the `HTML` tags and generate a `DOM Tree`.
2. When parsing `<link>` or `<style>` tags, start parsing `CSS` to generate `CSSOM`. It is worth noting that the parsing of `HTML` tags and the parsing of `CSS` are executed in parallel at this time.
3. When encountering a `<script>` tag, the browser will immediately start parsing the script and stop parsing the document. This is because the script may alter the `DOM` and `CSS`, so continuing parsing would be a waste of resources. Therefore, `<script>` tags should be placed after `<body></body>`.
4. Once the `DOM Tree` and `CSSOM` are generated, the two are combined to perform layout, calculating their size, position, and other layout information to form an internal representation model that can represent all this information, known as the render tree.
5. Based on the calculated information, draw the entire page. The system will traverse the render tree and call the `paint` method to display the content on the screen.

### Repaint
When some elements in the `render tree` need to update their properties, and these properties only affect the appearance and style of the elements without affecting the layout, such as `background-color`, it is called a repaint.

### Reflow
When a part (or all) of the `render tree` needs to be rebuilt due to changes in the size, layout, or visibility of elements, this is called reflow, also known as relayout. Every page needs at least one reflow, which happens when the page is first loaded, as the `render tree` needs to be built.

### Kernels
* `IE` browser: `Trident` kernel, also known as the `IE` kernel.
* `Chrome` browser: collectively referred to as the `Chromium` kernel or `Chrome` kernel, formerly the `Webkit` kernel, now the `Blink` kernel.
* `Firefox` browser: `Gecko` kernel, commonly known as the `Firefox` kernel.
* `Safari` browser: `Webkit` kernel.
* `Opera` browser: originally its own `Presto` kernel, then `Webkit`, now the `Blink` kernel.

## JS Engine
The role of the `JS` engine is relatively consistent and must include `DOM` (Document Object Model, a standard programming interface recommended by the W3C organization for handling `XML`) and `BOM` (Browser Object Model, providing objects for interaction with the browser window independent of the content, such as the `window` object) in the browser's implementation. The browser generally uses public `APIs` to create objects that reflect `DOM` objects into `JavaScript`. The `JS` engine is responsible for interpreting, compiling, and executing `JavaScript` to achieve some dynamic effects on web pages.

### Engines
* `Chrome` browser: `V8` engine.
* `Safari` browser: `JavaScriptCore` engine.
* `Firefox` browser: `TraceMonkey` engine.
* `Opera` browser: `Carakan` engine.
* `IE3~IE8` browser: `JScript` engine.
* `Edge` browser: `Chakra` engine.
